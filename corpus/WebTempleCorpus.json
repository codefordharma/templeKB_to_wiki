Kanyakumari Devi Temple is situated in Tamil Nadu. Kanyakumari is a cape at the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula. During British rule, it was known as Cape Comorin. The closest major cities are Nagercoil, the capital of Kanyakumari district 22kms  and Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala 85 kms .Kanyakumari got its name from the Kumari Amman or the Kanyakumari Temple situated at the shore on the confluence of the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. Devi Kanya Kumari, that is, the virgin goddess, is an aspect of Parvathy. She is known by several other names, including Kanya Devi, Devi Kumari, and Kumari Amman.  The Kanyakumari temple has been mentioned in the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Sangam works Manimekalai and Puranaanooru. The name Kanyakumari stands for Kanya Virgin  and Kumari girl .  The demon king Banasura grand son of Mahabali  did penance to get a boon from Lord Shiva. He obtained a boon from Lord Shiva that he could be vanquished only by a virgin. Later he became the emperror of the three worlds. His evil ways had caused much agony to Devas,sages and saints. Unable to bear the harassment of the demon king Bhoomi Devi Mother Earth  and the Devas approached Lord Vishnu and requested him to kill Banasura. Mahavishnu advised them to worship Sathi Parvathy  the Goddess of the universe to vanquish the demon. Answering the prayers of the oppressed, Shakti appeared as Kumari a young virgin girl  and promised to annihilate the evil forces championed by Banasura. Asking the devas to be patient for the right time for the killing of Banasura, Devi travelled to the southern most tip of India, where she began to meditate upon Lord Shiva. As time went on she grew into a teenager. This is how the southern tip of India got the name Kanya Kumari, as kanya kumari means \"a virgin teenaged girl\" at Kanyakumari and commenced penance with the desire of marrying Shiva at Suchindram.  Lord Shiva  from nearby Suchindrum  was so enchanted by the beauty of Goddess Kumari that he decided to marry her. The divine sage, Narada, felt this would endanger the chances of destroying Banasura, for it was preordained that the king of demons could meet his death only at the hands of a virgin. Therefore, Narada had to find someway to scuttle the marriage.  First Narada tried to confuse Kanya Kumari, telling her that Shiva is not powerful than Banasura. Narada told the goddess that she should ask Shiva to bring three items that could not be obtained anywhere in the world in order to prove his identity. These were a coconut without eyes, a stalk of sugarcane without stump joints and a betel leaf without veins. But Lord Shiva easily fulfilled this difficult challenge and the marriage continued to be scheduled.  Narada, fixed the midnight hour as the auspicious time for the wedding. When Shiva's procession reached a site by name Vazhukkumpaarai, Narada falsely heralded the break of dawn by assuming the form of a cock. On hearing the crowing of thr cock, Lord Shiva presumed the auspicious hour had past, turned back and returned to Suchindrum. Meanwhile, in Kanyakumari all waited for Lord Shiva's arrival and eventually, when he didn't turn up, the wedding ceremonies were cancelled. The rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked. It is said that in Kanya Kumari's anger over Shiva not arriving that she scattered all the food items that had been assembled for the wedding. Today tourists can buy tiny stones which look like rice, in remembrance of the marriage that was never solemnized.   The disappointed Kumari Devi decided to do penance and continue with her quest to fight the evil forces of Banasura. The Devi resumed Her penance on the rock, now known as Sripadaparai, a few hundred metres offshore. Meanwhile, Banasura heard about the beauty of the girl and came to request Her hand in marriage. When Devi rejected the idea, the demon king decided to win her by force. This led to a fierce battle, which ended with Kanya Kumari slaying Banasura with her chakra  divine discus  in Mahadana Puram  4 km north of Kanya Kumari .  It is said that at the moment of his death, Banasura repented for his adharmic acts and prayed to Parashakti to have compassion upon him and absolve him and anyone else who bathed in the waters off Kanya Kumari of their sins. Devi granted Banasura the boon, and this is why people come from all over the world to bathe in this holy confluence of seas. The relieved Devas returned blessed. Lord Parasurama and Sage Narada requsted to stay there till the end of Kaliyuga. The goddess agreed and remains at this place ever dedicated to Lord Shiva and continues to perform austerities to this day with the hopes that he will one day unite with her.  Later Parasurama built a temple on the shores and installed a beautiful idol of Goddess Kanya Kumari. The beautiful image of the Goddess in resplendent glory, with a garland in her right hand doing eternal penance as she waits for Lord Shiva to come, bestows on the devotee immense wealth of spiritual energy and peace of mind.  One specialty of the idol is her diamond nose ring. The sparkling diamond nose ring of the deity is said to be visible even from the sea. The temple's legend says that the nose ring was obtained from a king cobra and that light reflects off it so brightly that once an ancient mariner mistook it for a lighthouse. Sailing his ship towards the beacon, he wrecked upon the Kanya Kumari rocks. In order to prevent such a tragedy from happening again, the eastern door of the temple is only opened on five special occasions throughout the year.  Lord Ganesha, Surya and Ayyappa have separate shrines. There are also shrines to Vijayasundari and Balasundari, friends and playmates of the Goddess in her youthful form. A well inside the temple known as Moola Ganga Theertham, provides water for the Devi's abhishekam. The eastern entrance, facing the sea, remains closed throughout the year except for the Aaraattu rituals. The eastern door is opened also on new moon days in the months of Edavam, Karkkidakam  Capricorn and Cancer , during Navaratri and in the month of Vrischikam.  The poojas in this temple are carried out according to the Tanthrasamuchayam like the temples in Kerala. Kanya Kumari temple is considered as a Kerala temple and was once part of the erstwhile Travancore kingdom. The Vaisakha festival is celebrated in the tamil month of Vaikasi  May  where an image of the goddess is taken around town in procession on various mounts. The car festival, the Aaraatu  when the eastern door to the shrine is opened  and the float festival here are of significance. The Kalabham  sandal  festival in the month of Aadi  Karkkidakam  is also of importance here, when the image is covered with sandal paste, and on the 13th day, ie. the last Friday of the month, vast crowds throng the temple as the image is covered with vast quantities of flowers brought in from several villages in the vicinity. An image of the deity is held in worship at the Navaratri mandapam throughout the duration of Navaratri, and processions mark the festive celebrations on each of the nine nights. The destruction of Baanasuran is enacted on Vijaya Dasami, the concluding day of the Navaratri festival, where an image of the deity is taken in procession on a horse mount to a nearby village   Mahadanapuram.  For thousands of years, this southern most tip of the sub continent has been one of India's main pilgrimage sites, as bathing in Kanya Kumari's waters is said to absolve one of all sins. The tradition here is to take a holy dip at the bathing ghat at the confluence of the three seas. There are about 25 Theerthams on the shores.  The Sripadaparai is now known as Swami Vivekananda Rock, where the holy feet of the Goddess is enshrined. Swami Vivekananda is said to have sat in deep meditation on this rock and obtained the blessings from Devi. A memorial built in his honor is accessible via ferry. There is also a recently built memorial to Tiruvalluvar, the author of the philosophical work Tirukkural   a treatise on the Indian way of life.If you have any aditional information photo of Kanyakumari Temple, please mail to sukeshpala gmail.com  ", "answers": [[" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "kanyakumari"], [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "kanyakumari"], [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "], [" ", "[CLS] who is the diety ?

Our capital city also boasts of a number of ancient Hindu temples that were constructed hundreds of years ago. Talking about ancient temples in Delhi, the first name that strikes my mind is that of Kalka Ji temple.  The temple is the abode of Goddess Kalka, popularly known as Maa Kaali, an avatar of Goddess Durga. The shrine of Goddess Kali is said to be the self manifested one and dates back to the Satya Yuga, the time when the Goddess had incarnated to kill the demon Raktabija. Legend has it that Lord Krishna and the Panadavas have worshipped the Goddess at this shrine during the time of Mahabharata. The temple is said to have built in 1764 AD but the present structure was constructed in the early 20th century with the contributions from the devotees.  The structure of the temple is made up of marble and black pumice stones. It is a twelve sided structure with a verandah that encloses the main complex on all sides. The black stone inside the structure denotes Goddess Kali. The temple complex is a simple structure with hardly any ostentation. Kaali Dharamshala in the temple premises was built specially for the convenience of the visitors and their accommodation.

This destination may be quite similar to every one as it s a main trade centre of south .But a good number of the people are oblivious  about the Naga Temple here, which is very old and of  enormous devotional significance.  An extremely dedicated Namboothiri of Meayykattu Illam undergone a Bhjanam for twelve days at Thiruvanjikkulam Temple in order to get rid of his scarcity. Lord Siva, pleased with his devotion and obligation, assigned Vaasuki to come into sight before the poor man.Vasuki appeared before the Namboothiri and presented him the valuable Nagamanikya , which will help him to eliminate his dearth. The Namboothiri, from that day started to worship Nagaraja and Nagayakshi. The Illam then became popular as Paambummekkatillam.Every disease due to  Sarpakopam  affected due to the curse of snakes   has treatment in this place and thus it  became admired everywhere.  Once the Namboothiri treated and cured Pandyaking s skin ailment at his courtand was returning all the way through the thick forested place called Koottar, which is now called Nagrcoil .Hearing a loud cry of a lady, the group went there and were astonished to see blood from a stone .The lady was trying to grind a iron mace against a rock. Namboothiri recognized the stone as an idol of a five headed snake. Knowing the importance of the place Naamboothiri did all the Pooja procedures and made a small temple with idol of snake. They made a hut with coconut leaves and cleared way. Namboothiri offered various Poojas and shaped rules and regulations for the same. From then, the temple was called Nagercoi  Temple of Naga .Nagaraja was satisfied and the temple was showered with all the prosperity. Once the Nagaraja appeared before Namboothiri s dream and said that he wish to live in the same small Tempe and not want to move to any other place which holds more amenities.

Only the place where the Nagaraja seats is wet .The soil here underneath the Prathishta has a saffron colour.It is because of the blood that oozed form the head of the idol. The soil is given as Prasada.The soil will not lessen even though lots of quantity is being taken day by day. This soil is considered as a good medicine for skin diseases. The surrounding walls of temple are made of mud. The roof is constructed using coconut leaves and bamboo polls.   Once Pambummekkavu Namboothiri transferred his Pooja duties to Neelakanta Bhatathiri. At that time the Pambummekkattu Illam witnessed menace in the form of sufferings and child tragedies.As a assertion of his guilt, from that year Pambummekkatu Illam and Paravoor Illam began to do the Thanthric  duties at this temple in successive years in an alternative manner.Cheruthazham Perkulathtu Narayanan Namboothir, Govindan Namboothiri,Perkkandillam Madhavan Nambothiri were some of the main Thanthris of  this temple.

Palayoor Mahadeva Temple does not exist today. This temple was demolished by Christians and a Church was built in that place. Christians claims that this church was built by St. Thomas. The Christian story goes like this.  Palayoor was a sea port, there were lots of Jews who were traders. St. Thomas stayed with these traders and converted a lot of people to Christianity. In one of the Temple ponds he performed a miracle. By this \"Experience\" many Brahmins accepted Christianity while the other Brahmin families cursed the place and left saying that they will bathe their next bath at Vemmanadu 5 kms away from Palayoor . Even today the place is known as Sapa kadu or Chavakadu which means The forest of curse. The unhappy Brahmins went to Vemmanadu and settled down there. The temple was then destructed and a new church was created. Saint Thomas founded 7 1 2 Churches, of which the Palayoor church was the first. The other 6 1 2 churches are  Kodungallore, Paravur, Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal Nilakkal , Korakkeni, Kollam and a half church 'Arappalli' at Thiruvankottu.   But Historians does not agree the Christian claim. Their views are summorized here.     The first church of Kerala was constructed in 849 CE at Quilon Kollam . Then the Hindu King of Venadu, Ayyan Adikal Thiruvadikal had granted permission to the Christian merchants of Quilon to construct a church. This royal grant is known as Tharissappalli Copperplate Grant of 849 CE. This is the first valid authentic document relating to the Christian history of India.  This church is one among the 8 churches.        Until 1550 CE no reference pertaining to the construction or existence of a Christian church is available. There is not even a single comment about christianity among natives or brahmins in Kerala in Sanga literature of first millenium CE.      There was less than half a dozen Christian churches functioned all over Kerala until the sixteenth century. The subsequent centuries witnessed the rapid growth of church and Christianity in Kerala due to the coercive tactics of European colonial interests. But at present more than 1000 churches are claiming 1000 to 1900 years of existence.      This 'Seven and a half' concept is the replica of the ritual of the renowned Hindu temple at Ettumannoor where the main deity is Lord Shiva. The Christian church emerged as strong force in Kerala during the European period around this temple region. That is why the Christian faith on account of the importance and social recognition to the said temple incorporated the idea of seven and a half in their faith in the form of church.       The first organised temple destruction of Kerala took place at Palayoor in the 16th century under the stewardship of Francis Xavier, who was the architect of inquisition in Goa.     In 1952 CE, the native Catholic Church hierarchy approached the Papacy Rome  for Pontifical approval to celebrate 1900th year of Thomas s venture of proselytism of Kerala. Papacy instantaneously declined the humble request of the Kerala Catholics on the ground that the claim  has no historicity.      The Malayattoor Church near Kalady in Ernakulam district was Shiva temple and it has no connection with St. Thomas. The revenue records of the old princely state of Travancore justify this fact.   Fr. Herman D'Souza, in In the Steps of St. Thomas, writes  \"The Palayur temple  deserted by  the Brahmins as a result of St. Thomas's efforts, was turned into a church. Pieces of  broken idols and remnants of the old temple were lying around the church till a short time ago.  Two large tanks, one on the eastern side of the church and the other near the western gate, are  tell tale relics of the ancient glory of the Hindu temple.\" D'Souza was writing in 1983 and  includes pictures of the old temple walls, well and tank in his book.   The Palayoor church authorities until the day of the collapse of the disputed structure at Ayodhya, kept a board in front of the church that read \"the church is constructed by St. Thomas after demolishing a temple\" Now the board has been removed . Even Vatican Papacy  is not ready to believe the story of the arrival of St. Thomas in Kerala; it is true that the demolition of the temple might have taken place only after the European occupation of this land.It is believed that the temple destruction was inaugurated by St. Francis Xavier in AD 1545. Broken pieces of idols, sculptures and remenants of the old temple were lying around the church till a short time ago. Two large tanks on the west and east gates of the church tells the ancient glory of the Mahadeva temple. The well and compound wall of the temple existed were destroyed recently. There is not a single Brahmin house, at present, in the Palayoor village. According to Kerala Brahmins Palayoor is the place where an elephant became a goat Aana aadaakum idam . Here elephent points to the great Mahadeva temple and goat points to the church.

Shiva here is more popularly known as Vadakkunnathan. Vadakkunnatha Temple is situated at the heart of Thrissur city. The name Thrissur is derived from 'Thiru Shiva Peroor', which literally translates to \"The city of the sacred Shiva\". Thrissur was also known as Vrishabhadripuram, Vrishachala and Thenkailasam or Dakshina Kailasam Kailasa of the south  in ancient days.      Vadakkunnathan temple is surrounded by a massive stone wall enclosing an area of nearly 8 9 acres. Inside this fortification there are four gopurams indicating the four directions   North, South, East and West. Apart from these four gopurams there is a multi shrined complex in the center with three principal shrines dedicated to Shiva or Vadakkunnathan, Shankaranarayana and Rama. Lord Vettekkaran  Shiva in a hunter form  is also worshipped within the nalambalam enclosure.      In the northern side there is a circular structure with the deity facing west. The figure of Shiva Parvati faces east and is just behind Shiva,in the same shrine. The two storied shrine of Sri Rama facing west is located in the south. Between these two srikovils stand a third one, circular and double storied in shape, dedicated to Sankaranarayana and facing west. There are mukhamandapams in front of all the three central shrines.      The idol of Shiva, which is not visible, is covered under a mount of ghee, formed by the daily abhisheka  ablution  with ghee over the years. After abhisheka a portion of the ghee is returned to the devotees and they take it home as the ghee has miraculous powers to cure all diseases. A devotee looking at the sanctum now sees a thirteen foot high mount of ghee embellished with thirteen cascading crescents of gold and three serpent hoods at top. According to traditional belief, this represents the snow clad Mount Kailas, the abode of Parvathy and Parameswara.      Outside the nalambalam, there are shrines for Lord Krishna, Vrishabha, Parasurama, Simhodara, Dharmasastha and Adi Sankaracharya. Adi Sankara is believed to have been born to the Shivaguru Aryamba couple of Kalady in answer to their prayers before Vadakkunnathan, as amsavatara incarnation  of the Lord. Legend has it that Shiva appeared to both husband and wife in their dreams, and offered them a choice  a mediocre son who would live a long life, or an extraordinary son who would not live long. Both Shivaguru and Aryamba chose the latter. The son was named Shankara, in honour of Shiva.      Not only in the case of physical structures, but also in the matter of rituals, poojas and even in the order of movement of a worshipper from sanctum to sanctum, the temple maintains a uniqueness of its own. It is believed that you have to follow a certain order when moving between the temples. It is advisable to ask somebody inside this temple for this. The temple opens at three in the morning and closes about 10 30 after the morning rites. For the evening worship it opens at four and closes at 8.30 at night after trippuka, the last rite for the day.      The murals in the temple are known for its rarity and two of them   Vasukisayana and Nrithanatha   are even worshipped regularly. A fairly large white bullock on the verandah of the Nalambalam is worshipped as Nandikeswara. In the temple quadrangle, there are specified spots at which the devotees can offer their salutations to Lord Shiva of Kasi and Lord Chidambaranatha of Chidambaram, Lord of Shiva of Rameswara, Sree Kali of Kodungallur, Urakam Ammathiruvadi, Lord Bharatha  Koodalmanickam  at Irinjalakuda, Sree Vyasa, Sree Hanuman and serpent gods.      The temple theatre, known as koothambalam, has no parallel to cite anywhere else in the world. The four magnificent gateways called gopurams and the lofty masonry wall around the temple quadrangle are also imposing pieces of craftsmanship and skill.      Lord Ganesh in the temple is positioned facing the temple kitchen and offering of Appam  sweetened rice cake fried in ghee  to Mahaganapathy is one of the most important offerings at Vadakkunnathan temple. Propitiating Ganapathy here is believed to be a path to prosperity and wealth. The devotees revere elephants as Lord Ganesh incarnate. It has been the regular annual practice at the Vadakkunnathan Temple for the last 20 years to conduct a large scale Ashta Dravya Maha Ganapathy Havana and Aanayoottu  ceremonial feeding of elephants  on the 1st day of karkkidakom month as per the malayalam calendar. Gajapooja also is conducted once in four years.      Vadakkunnathan temple is one of the oldest in South India according to the archaeologists. Vadakkkunnathan Temple is one of the largest temples in Kerala that is dedicated to Lord Shiva. This temple is a classic example of the Kerala style of architecture with beautiful murals of the seventeenth century delineating graphically the story of Mahabharata. The shrines and the Koothambalam display exquisite vignettes carved in wood. It is said that Tipu Sultan camped near this temple during his raid on northern Kerala. But this fact is disputed by a number of historians.      There is no annual festival for Vadakkunnatha. The important ceremony of this temple is Shivarathri and the idol of Vadakkumnatha is not taken out for procession. On the Thrikkarthika day in Vrischikam November December  morning poojas for Vadakkunnatha are conducted at the Southern compound wall.It is believed that on this day Lord Vadakkunnatha will sit on the compound wall looking Southwards to see his wife's Kumaranalloor Kathyayani Devi  return procession after the Thrikkarthika bath in Meenachil river. Vilwamangalam Swamiyar once visited this temple in the morning on Thrikkarthika day. He realized the absence of Vadakkunnatha inside the Sreekovil. So he went around and found the Lord on the compound wall. It was Vilwamangalam who started the pooja on Southern compound wall on Thrikkarthika day.      The sprawling Thekkinkadu maidan, en circling the Vadakumnathan temple Thrissur Swaraj Round , is the main venue of the Thrissur Pooram in Medam April May . Vadakkunnathan is a mere spectator at this festival, lending its premises and grounds for the great event. The pooram is celebrated by mainly other two temples and Vadakkunnathan is not taking part in the festival or in the procession. Thrissur Pooram is the most colourful temple festival of Kerala and it attracts large masses of devotees and spectators from all parts of the state and even outside. It consists of processions of richly caparisoned elephants from various neighbouring temples to the Vadakumnathan temple. The most impressive processions are those from the Krishna Temple at Thiruvambadi and the Devi Temple at Paramekkavu which is quite a significant event for its devotees.      The Pooram Festival is celebrated by two rival groups representing the two divisions of Thrissur Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi vying with each other in making the display of fireworks grander and more colourful. Each group is allowed to display a maximum of fifteen elephants and all efforts are made by each party to secure the best elephants in South India and the most artistic parasols, several kinds of which are raised on the elephants during the display. Commencing in the early hours of the morning, the celebrations last till the break of dawn, the next day.      The procession of the Thiruvambadi Pooram to the grounds of Vadakkumnatha Temple and back is not only important, but also quite enlivening. The marvellous as well as magical effect of the Panchavadyam, a combination of five percussion and wind instruments is to be felt and enjoyed. Among the varieties of festivals celebrated in Kerala, Thrissur Pooram is the most thunderous, spectacular and dazzling. The main attraction of the pooram is the Elanjitharamelam, a two hours Chendavadyam   with five instruments   near koothambalam, by the top most artists in the state. The fifty and odd caparisoned elephants gather out side South gopuram face to face, known as \"Koodikazhcha\" with the accompaniment of Panchavadyam. Then the Kudamattom   Changing of parasols   is performed. The ornamental silken parasols unfurled, of several types and colours changed competitively. It is an expression of popular fascination for sound and colour, and because of the pageantry, it appeals to all people. The images of the deities from all temples of the village are taken on elephants to the main temple. The climax of the festival is the exhibition of thirty elephants and the famous fireworks at 2.30 am local time.pooram kudamattam      The two century old festival of spectacular procession of caparisoned elephants and enthralling percussion performances in a never ending succession is an 36 hours marathon event of incredible beauty, a feast for the eye and the ear, unfolding between 6 a.m. to noon the other day. Different from the usual temple festival, Thrissur Pooram is participated and conducted by people across all barriers of religion and caste.      Before the advent of Thrissur Pooram, the largest temple festival during summer in central Kerala was the one day festival held at Arattupuzha, 12 km south of the town. Temples in and around Thrissur were regular participants of this religious exercise until they were once denied entry by the responsible chief of the Peruvanam area of Cherpu, known for its Namboodiri supremacy. As an act of reprisal and also in a bid to assuage their wounded feelings, Raja Rama Varma  1751 1805 , also known as Sakthan Thampuran the ruler of the Cochin state invited all these temples to bring their deities to Thrissur where they could pay obeiance to Lord Vadakunnathan. Further he directed the main temples of Thrissur, Thiruvambadi and Paramekkavu, to extend all help and support to these temples. It is this historical background that determines the course of the Pooram program and it is specifically the ruler's antipathy to the Brahmin aristocracy to open Thrissur pooram for the common man.      Adhering to the medieval Peruvanam tradition, the festival is confined to the temples of Devi  goddess  and Sastha  divine combination of Shiva and Vishnu . Ten deities from the neighboring temples pay obeisance to the presiding deiety of Thrissur and only spectator of the Pooram events, Lord Siva at the Sree Vadakkunnathan temple.      Principle participants are Paramekkavu and Tiruvambadi. Also participating and known as 'Cherupooram' are the suburban temples at Kanimangalam, Karamukku, Choorakkattukara, Laloor, Ayyanthole, Neithilakkavu, Chembukkavu and Panamukkampilly altogether 8 deities.      The Vadakkunnatha temple is currently being renovated under the auspices of the ASI  Archeological Survey of India  with the help of liberal grants from the TVS group.

As a temple with Lord Bhartha as deity is a rarity, there are arguments that once this temple belonged to the Jains  Bharatheswara saint of Jains  and with the descent of Jainism this temple was taken over by Hindus.        Irinjalakkuda in former days is believed to have the confluence of two rivers, the place name Iruchalkkidai suggests such a conjecture. The Lord at the confluence is thus known as Sangameswara. Though the two rivers  Kurumali river and Chalakudy river  have changed course and Irinjalakuda is no longer on any river bank, Arattu is held alternatively in these two rivers suggesting a previous connection with these rivers.        The lord at Koodalmanikyam is Chathurbahu Vishnu with Conch, Chakra, Gada and Japamaala. The general belief, however, is that the Lord is Bharatha the brother of Sree Rama. A distinctive feature of Koodalmanikyam temple is that there is only one single Prathista. Even Vigneswara, usually found in all temples dose not find place here. Usually when Thulasi leaves are offered to the diety, its seeds invariably sprouts in the premises. How this has not at any time happened in this temple is a mystery. One explanation is that Thulasi plant being sacred; it is worshipped wherever it is found. Probably it is to forbid even such an object of secondary worship in the temple precincts that Thulasi is not allowed to grow by some unforeseen power.

The name Thiruvalla is a colloquial form of Sreevallabhapuram, named after the chief deity Sree Vallabha. The ancient name of Thiruvalla was \"Valla vai\". This name had some relation with the river Manimala which was known as Valla puzha, suggesting that Thiruvalla was at the mouth bank of river Manimala and hence was known as Valla vai. Thiruvalla was under the rulership of Ay, Nantuzhainadu, Thekkumkoor and Thiruvithamkoor dynasties.   The idol of Maha Vishnu or Sree Vallabha was sculpted by Viswakarma at the behest of Lord Krishna and was given to Satyaki at the end of Dwapara Yuga. Towards the end of Dwapara Yuga, Lord asked Garuda to keep the idol in safe custody and accordingly Garuda kept it in Netravati river which flows from Karnataka to Kerala. Later, the royal consort of Cheraman Perumal   the emperor of Kerala had a dream that the idol of Krishna was lying on the bed of Netravati river. All efforts were taken to search the idol. At last the idol was discovered from the Bhadra Hrada of Netravati river in B. C 59 with the joint effort of the Tulu Brahmins and the local potties  Malayala Brahmins or Nampoothiries . Cheraman Perumal built a temple at Thiruvalla to install the idol. The Prathishta  installation  ritual was conducted on 14th day of Edavam in B.C 59  Kaliyugam 3043 .  Sree Vallabha is portrayed as bearing a conch, a discus and a lotus. The Sudarshana Chakram seen through the west cardinal door of the sanctum is held in worship and is believed to have been installed in the 13th century. Historical evidence such as copper plates and proclamations point to Tiruvalla as a flourishing and major center of spiritual and educational prominence in AD 1100. The Sree Vallaba Temple governed a Vedic School with one thousand students and one hundred teachers.   The temple compound is more than 8 acres. The huge compound wall is 12 feet high and 562 feet long  in one side . There are four gopurams  in typical Kerala style in four directions. North gopuram will be opened only on Uthram day in Meenam. While entering through the main gopuram the devotees will first see the three storied Garuda Madam. Inside this Garuda Madam there is a 53.5 feet high and 2.5 feet wide granite dwaja. A granite dwaja was carved out of single piece and was installed here in B.C 59 as an offering to Lord Sree Vallabha by Queen Cherumthevi, the wife of Cheraman Perumal. At the time of installation of the dwaja, Garuda appeared himself at the top of the dwaja. This dwaja till remains as a wonder. Later the dwaja slanted. So a structure called Garuda Madam was constructed to support the dwaja.  It was designed by the legendary Perumthachan. He made a 3 feet high panachaloha Garuda Vigraha  idol  to install on the top of the dwaja. This was the original dwaja of this temple and later a separate golden dwaja was installed in between Garuda Madam and the balikkalppura on 14th May 1970.   The temple pond is called Ilavanthi theertham and is located at the north east corner of the temple. The big Oottupura is situated at the north side of the temple. Once there was a Koothambalam but was distroyed by fire. The pradakshina veedhi is 104 feet long in one side. The nalambalam is made of granite and there is a vilakkumadam outside the nalambalam. The sreekovil is circular in shape with copper covered conical roof. Lord Sree Vallabha facing east and Lord Sudarsana or Chakrathazhvar facing west are installed in the same sreekovil. There are 8 subdieties in this temple. Varahamoorthy, Vadakkumthevar, Ganapathy, Garuda, Sastha, Kurayappan Swami, Ayal yakshi, Maya yakshi and Dakshinamoorthy are the subdieties. Shrines for Vadakkumthevar and Vishwaksena are inside the nalambalam and shrines of Sastha, Ganapathy and Kurayappan swami are outside the nalambalam. Varahamoorthy and Dakshinamoorthy shrines are in the main sreekovil of Sree Vallabha. Ayal yakshi and Maya yakshi were installed on the both sides of the vathilmadam.  The rule for darshan at this temple is like this   first offer prayers to Ganapathy, Sastha, Bhagavathy and Kurayappan swami outside the nalambalam. Then visit Ilavanthi Theertham and offer prayers to Sage Vyasa.  Then offer prayers to Sage Durvasa and then to Garuda at the top of the dwaja. Then enter isnside the nalambalam and offer prayers to Vishwaksena, Dakshinamoorthy and reach infront of the sreekovil. Then offer prayers to Lakshmi Devi , bhumi Devi and Lord Sree Vallabha. Then start the pradakshinam inside the nalambalam and offer prayers to Lord sudarsana in the west nada.  Sree Vallabha Temple is a mahakshetra with five poojas and three sheevelis daily. The pooja style is based on Pacncharatra Samhitha especially on Durvasa Samhitha. Worship protocol is called Purusha Narayana Pooja.

After athazha pooja a ritual called Pallikkuruppu for Lord Sree Vallabha and Lakshmi Devi will be held at Palliyara and closes the doors of the temple. It is believed that Sage Durvasa will perform Ardhayama pooja for sree Vallabha in the midnight. In the morning poojas begins after Palliyyunarthal at Palliyara.   Tantries or chief priests are Thukalasseri Tharayil Kuzhikkattu Bhattathiri and Thekkedathu Kuzhikkattu Bhattathiri. As the Tulu Brahmins and the local potties jointly found the idol of Lord Sree Vallabha, the performance of poojas to the diety was shared amongst themselves as a commemoration of the incident. Hence, the tulu Brahmins offer pooja for 15 days and the Patthillatthil potties  potties from 10 houses  perform pooja for 15 days. Pala namaskaram  nivedyam offering in aracanut leaves  is a special ritual in this temple. Famous Malayalm poet Vishnu Nara  Lord Sree Vallabha likes Kathakali very much and hence it is an important offering here. Kathakali, the folk art of kerala, is performed almost on all days in this temple as offerings by devotees. Usually stroies like Thukalasura Vadham, Santhanagopalam and Sree Vallabha Charitham will be performed as an offering to Sree Vallabha.  Women are not allowed near the sanctum sanctorum   except on the Vishu and Thiruvathira days. Elephants are not permitted inside the temple compound. The ten day long annual festival is in Kumbham with kodiyettu on Pooyam day. Arattu is performed in Manimala river at Thukalassery Kadalimangalam Kadavu. On arattu day Sree Vallabha visits Lord Mahadeva of Thukalassery Temple. The Uthraseeveli festival is celebrated for one day on the Makayiram asterism in Meenam  March   April . The north gopuram will be opened only for the uthraseeveli. On that day Goddess Durga of Alamthuruthy Padappadu Temple and Bhagavthy of Kariyanattukavu Temple will visit Lord Sree Vallabha. These Goddesses are the protectors of Thiruvalla Gramam. The auspicious  Pantheerayiram vazhipadu,' offering of 12,001 plantains of a special variety to the presiding deity is very famous. The ceremonial procession starts from the nearby Mahadevar Temple at Thukalassery. Twice in a year, the Lord is dressed like a hunter  on Thiruvathira in Dhanu and Vishu in Medam   Thiruvalla Temple was once a place famous for Vedic schools. There were more than 1000 students and 100 teachers in this vedic school and was famous as Thiruvalla Sala. It was as famous as Thirumoozhikkulam Sala  vedic school in Thirumoozhikkulam Temple   another divya desam in Kerala  and was bigger than Niranam Sala and Kaviyoor sala.   In pasurams of Tirumangaialwar and Nammalwar, Thiruvalla is refered as Thiruvallavai, Sree Vallabha as Sree Kolapiran Perumal and Thayar  Mahalakshmi  as Selva Thirukozhunthu Naachiyaar or Vaathsalya Devi. Thiumangai alwars pasurams  1806 1817 in Nalayiram divya prabhandham  and Nammalwars pasurams 2612 2622 in Nalayiram divya prabhandham  praises the glory of Sree Vallabha. There are several inscriptions in this temple and one is dated back to 12th century and is called Thiruvalla Sasanam. Sree Vallabha Kshetra Mahatmyam in Sanskrit written in the tenth century praises the glory of Sree Vallabha. Sree Vallabha Charitham Kavyam, Thukalasura Vadham  kathakali , Sree Vallabha vijayam, Sree Vallabheswara suprabhatham, Yajanavali samgraham and Sree Vallabha Karnamrita stothram also praises the glories of Sree Vallabha.   The conduct of poojas in the Kerala Temples is devised mainly as per the principles contained in Tantric Texts. The authority in this field could be traced to the text \"Tantra Samuchayam\" written by Brahmasree Chennas Manackal Narayanan Namboodirippadu in the year 1427. But the pooja system followed in Sree Vallabha Temple is entirely different and the Melsanthi in Sree Vallabha Maha Temple, should be capable of performing \"Pancharaatra School of Vaishnava Pooja\" in the Temple. The said pooja could be performed only by a Karanma Santhi having hereditary competence and right as far as the Temple is concerned. There are altogether five families, who were having Karanma right for functioning as Melsanthi in Sree Vallabha Maha Temple. Those families are  1  Ambly,  2  Annankala,  3  Karakkadu,  4  Sreevelli and  5  Nedumbrathu Cherukudal. According to the Tantri, various poojas conducted in Sree Vallabha Maha Temple are unique and rare. The poojas are conducted according to the \"Yajanavali Text\" on the basis of Pancharaatra System contained in Sree Durvasa Samhita. Special Type of poojas are not being conducted in other temples under the Travancore Devaswom Board and close similarity could be seen as far as the poojas in Sree Poornathrayeesa Temple, Tripunithura is concerned. The unique and salient features of the conduct of poojas in Sree Vallabha Maha Temple are available in Chapter 21 of the book \"Sree Vallabha Maha Kshetra Charithram\" published by Sri. P. Unnikrishnan Nair. A detailed description is also available in the book \"Thulasiharam\" written by Smt. Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bai.

This temple is situated at adistance of 1km from Parumala junction in Thiruvalla   Mavelikkara road. Although this temple is one among the 108 Shivalayams, Bhadrakali is more famous than Shiva. Here Kali is called Panayannarkkavilamma. There are other Shivalayams in Kerala like Thirumandamkunnu, Kodungalloor, Kumaranalloor, and Chengannoor where the main Pratishta is Shiva but the importance is for Bhagavati. Panayannarkkavu is one among the three great Kali temples in Kerala. The other two are Thirumandhamkunnu and Kodungalloor. Mandala pooja, Shivarathri, Vishu and Thulam Aayilyam are the main festivals here.  Panayannarkavu North Nada of Chantadum BhgavathyPanayannarkavu West Nada of ShivaEast facing Sreekovil of Bhadrakali  Yakshis were supposedly vampirish beings who possesses satanic powers and were known to prowl and stalk human beings. They have a penchant for human blood and flesh .They trap their victims , usually men in the guise of women who are voluptuous and radiates an aura of maddening lust . Any one born male would gape at her lascivious and lustfull apparition. The tender   hearted and indulgent lot would fall for her amoural advances . The victim, usually alone, falls in to a trance and finds himself following her as she beckons him to a near by cottage deep in the woods . Once he is inside the cottage , the Yakshi unveils her true self , which is actually a horrifying sight with fiery red eyes , long spear like dentures , blood dripping tongue and unkempt hair which stands out . Such an appalling figure and wild high pitched animal screech like laughter would have already scared the living lights out of the victim throwing him in to a corpse like state . The Yakshi then quenches her thirst by sucking the life blood of the victim and the remains are left under the tree on which she dwells.  There was once such a famous , rather infamous Yakshi known as The Pynanarkavu Yakshi  Parumala yakshi  who was bound by the legendary hero Kadamuttathu achen a friar . The story goes...... In olden days, the route from Thiruvananthapuram to Padmanabhapuram served as a route to traverse from Thiruvananthapuram to the west and Padmanabhapuram to the east. It was a lonely winding path coursing through an uninhibited and desolate area covered by dense thickets and woods.On the whole it gave a creepy and formidable aura.During that time ,a Yakshi arrived from somewhere , found this stretch of the road habitable but forsaking for human life . Quiet a number of people were reported missing , especially those who chose to travel by this particular route and people started avoiding this route as much as possible.Sensing a steady decline in the availability of her preys , the Yakshi encroached in to civilization and started preying on men in there own living quarters .Terror stricken and weary due to such enchanting bewitchments , the villagers took a defensive stance by conferring with well known witch doctors and exorcists but was all in vain . The Yakshi continued her bestial sanguinary despite of the villager's futile attempts to drive her away . The news of this Yakshi spread far and wide across the land . Her news, also reached the ears of the legendary hero and priest Kadamuttathu achen   an expert conjurer  and he set out to nail down this blood sucking creature . After a few days of search , he met her in her usual guise of a sensually appealing woman in need for lime  slick . The achen was astounded by her surpassing beauty but with out wasting much time he offered her the lime on an iron nail ,which the Yekshi refused to accept and retreated but the achen insisted on accepting the lime on the nail which actually had magical formula to deplete the Yekshi's power. Continuous persuation and persistence of the achen , led to a forcible acceptance of the lime by the Yekshi . She lost all her dark powers and became a slave to Kadamuttathu achen , who had actually driven the magic nail in to her head .Parumala Valiya Panayannarkavu Sarppakkavu  Kadamuttathu achen had a very aged and old woman as a relative from his maternal side . This woman lived alone and the achen paid a visit to her along with the slave girl  Yekshi  and presented the slave girl as a help and companion to the old woman . The old woman was delighted and offered to prepare lunch for them . After lunch ,the achen laid down for an after noon nap while the old woman and the slave girl got to know each other, on which the old woman started to like the girl very much and after some time she offered to comb the girl's thick lush hair and while running the comb through the girl's hair, the comb snagged on the nail which the priest had secured . Alarmed at such an injury , the woman pulled out the nail upon which the girl vanished in to thin air.  Dumbfounded and confused the old woman woke up achen and related the incident . Upon hearing that the Yekshi had fled ,he too ran in the same direction and chased her . When she saw that the priest was following close at her heels, she increased her pace and both of them reached a placed called \"Mannar\" where she took the only boat and rowed across the pamba river and achen was left behind without a conveyance across the river . So he used his conjuring skills to bind the Yekshi at the opposite bank so that she was unable to move and was trapped . Again with his skills, he used a banana leaf as a conveyance and crossed the river.The Yekshi begged him ,not to destroy nor cast her in to the abyss . Kadamuttathu achen felt for her and made her to vow that she would never again be a threat to mankind ,but lead a peaceful life in the surrounding forest which is known as Pynanarkavu .  It is believed that she still haunts and dwells in this kavu  forest , invisible to the human eye ,but at times she has been cited by many people on several occasions, especially \" Karuthavavu\" and on Fridays .These sightings are described by the local people as an extremely beautiful woman or as a flying pillar of fire . To this day the Yekshi is known to have kept her promise to the legendary hero Kadamuttathu achen .

Hearing about the holiness of this place, they stayed here and worshipped Perumal in all the 4 forms. One idol was worshipped by Yudhistira, one by Bhima, one by Arjuna and one by Nakula and Sahadeva.  A brahmin who was a staunch Saivite stayed at Kasi and offered worship to Lord Visweswara. He was forced to leave Kashi and come to his native place as he heard that his mother was in her last stages and as he was reluctant to leave his Ishtadevata, he prayed to Lord Shiva for help. Lord Shiva entered into the Olakkuda  umbrella  which the brahmin used to have with him always. When the brahmin reached this place, it was evening. As he had to perform his evening rites, he left the umbrella in the temple premises and went to have bath. When he returned, he found that he could not lift the umbrella and when he exerted force, the umbrella broke and a Shiva ling emerged out of it. Lord Shiva told the brahmin that henceforth He would stay there and all the devotees could worship Him in that place. Hence, we can find a Siva Linga in the temple premises which is a Swayambhu.It is believed that the temple has the presence of Holy Ganga.  Each Shrine is architecturally exquisite.

The uniqueness of this temple is that inside the main sreekovil there are prathishtas of Sastha and Siva and also Sivalinga in the right hand of Sri Sastha. The belief is that Sastha is worshipping Siva. The deity is known as Markandeswaran on accountant of this. For the same reason sanidosha nivarana poojas like neeranjanam, saneeswara homam are found very effective. In addition the devi prathishta in rajarajeswari bhavam and ganapathy prathista for vignanivaranam and navagraha prathishtas for graha dosha nivaranam add to the chaithanyam and importance of this temple. This ancient temple was renovated in 2010 as per the directions of the temple acharyas. The renovation included the reconstruction of the upadevalayas and punaprathishta of devi and ganapathy vigrhas and new navagra prathishta. In March 2010 ashtabanda kalasa and kumbabhishekam were conducted.  The different methods of worship and concept of god, the ultimate reality, in kerala temples are unique and wonderful. The kallampally sastha temple is a typical example for this. The sastha deity in the center of the srikovil is having sivalingam in the right hand, the right foot is bent, left foot is bent and leaving a belt to the side. This is a sreekovil where the deity is in Dyanasanam  Meditation Pose . The prathista here can be said to be a very rare one generally in the right hand abhaya mudra is seen.

This sastha is known as markandeya sastha having controlled the prapanja sakthi in the eye, and having the shade of nagadeva s five goods on the fiery eye is the appearance of this lingam. This sivalingam represents the vast and limitless sakthi. Perhaps this is all comprehensive fully manifestation of sivam.  Another sivalingam is also inside the sreekovil which is prapanja purusha roopa and which is protected by five hoods of a serpant and which represents the five indriyas. Here the sastha deity also worship this siva bhava. Here the vahana of sastha is elephant. It is considered that this temple is older than the temple of sri padmanabha. Not only that, in divine power and chaithanya sri dharma sastha here stood first according to potty of Nethaseri Mana who owned this temple. According to a legendery strory told by sri. Krishnan potty of Nethassery Mana, the power of sri. Markandeya Sastha is indicated as follows. The prathista of sri. Padmanabha Swamy could not be made firm and it was realized that there was a more strong saiva chaithanyam in the area. That was why the vigraha prathishta could not be done. Further probe revealed that the mahasakthi is that of markandeya sastha. Then sastha preethi was performed for 41 days and after knowing the full consent of the saiva chaithanya only the prathista could be made firm satisfactorily.

The deity in this temple is famous as Ernakulathappan. This is one of the rare Shiva temples where deity is facing sea towards west.  Arjuna, the pandava performed a severe penance to propitiate Lord Shiva. Pleased with Arjuna's devotion Shiva accompanied with his consort Sri Parvathi set out from their abode at Kailash to meet Arjuna. Shiva disguises himself as \"Kiratha\" before appearing in front of Arjuna. Just as Shiva appears before Arjuna he sees a wild boar charging towards Arjuna and shoots an arrow at the boar. Arjuna, who is an accomplished archer, also shoots an arrow at the boar. The boar who was in fact a demon named Mookasura in disguise is killed and its original form is revealed. However, dispute arises between Arjuna and Kiratha as to who is the real killer of the animal. A battle ensues between the two, lasting a long time, ultimately resulting in Kiratha's victory over Arjuna.The vanquished Arjuna, unable to even stand up makes a Shiva Linga out the earth and performs a pooja offering flowers. To his surprise, he sees that the flower he offers over the Shiva Linga is falling over the head of Kiratha. Arjuna then realises that Kiratha is non other than his Lord Shiva. Shiva, in his true form, along with Parvathy appears before Arjuna and blesses him. He also gifts him the divine arrow, the Pasupathastram.  A rishi by name Devala killed a serpent by accident and was cursed by his guru. The curse turned his face into the hood of a snake and he acquired the name Nagarishi. It was ordained that a sustained period of Shiva worship would relieve him of the curse. He comes across the Shiva Linga made by Arjuna and takes it with him. After taking holy dips in the sacred rivers and praying at temples he arrives at \"Rishinagakulam\"   the ancient name of present Ernakulam. Finding that the place is suitable for Shiva Prasada, the Nagarshi places the Shiva Lingam on the ground and offers poojas. However, the locals harass him and he decides to leave with the Shiva Linga. On attempting to lift the Shiva Linga he finds that it has become fixed to the ground and cannot be moved. It is this Shiva Linga we see as Kirathamoorthy on the northern side of the temple.  Devalan peformed his rites here and is redeemed from the curse. At his request the Shiva and Parvathy appear here and exist in the form of Linga. It is this \"Gourisankara roopam\" that is seen as \"Swauambhoolingam\" in the Sreekovil. Later the temple was built and the diety installed.  The pooja methods were regularised as directed by the famous Vilwamangalathu Swamiyar. The Linga Prathishta was made facing west. Devotees who dedicate themselves to the lord with utmost devotion are said to be relieved of their suffering leading to ultimate 'Moksha'.  This temple has a golden flag staff.

Gokarna is 60 km south of Karwar and 7 hours from the city of Mangalore.  Ravana, king of Sri Lanka, did penance for the grace of Lord Shiva at Mount Kailash. Lord Shiva agrees to give Atmalingam with condition that the atmalingam should be physically carried and not placed anywhere on the ground, and it establishes wherever it is placed on earth. On his way, Ravana stops for bath and gives the atmalingam to Lord Ganesha who dressed up like a cowhered brahmin who promptly puts it down. His efforts to extricate it resulted in his throwing the coverings of the Linga to Dhareshwar, Gunavanteshwara, Murdeshwar and Shejjeshwar temples  the last places is very near Karwar . In spite of the might exerted by Ravana  Maha Bala , the Shivalingam stayed fixed, hence the name Mahabaleshwar. The pull exerted by Ravana, is said to have caused the Shivalinga to resemble the shape of a cow's ear and hence the name Gokarnam. The Ejjeshwara, Gunavanteshwara, Murudeshwara ,Dhareshwara and Mahabaleshwara temple are known as the Pancha Maha Kshetras.  Gokrana means cow's ear. It is believed that Lord Shiva emerged from the ear of a cow here. It is also located at the ear shaped confluence of two rivers Gangavali and Agnashini. However, according to the popular belief, it is named so to commemorate Lord Shiva's emergence from the ears of a cow. A mere visit to this temple liberates one from hundreds of sins including the deadliest ones such as 'brahma hatya'  the killing of a Brahmin or a pious person . Even a glimpse of the Atma linga of Lord Mahabaleswara, helps one to attain salvation and frees one from the cycle of births and rebirths. According to a legend, Lord Rudra went to Patalaloka for penance on the advice of Lord Brahma and returned through the ear of Mother Earth, often symbolized as a cow. Since the place served as the womb for him, it is also known as Rudra Yoni or Adi Gokarna.   Shivaratri festival is celebrated here with great enthusiasm. Each year a team builds up two great temple chariots which is used during the Shiva Ratri festival. The two great temple chariots lead a procession through the town's narrow streets, while priests and pilgrims chant hymns in praise of Shiva. More than a hundred people are needed to pull the chariots with thick ropes while priests conduct religious ceremonies inside.  Gokarna is also mentioned in the Shrimad Bhagvatha Purana as being the home of the two brothers Gokarna and Dhundhakari and the Bhagvathz also gives details of the difference in their temperament and nature and their exploits.

The Bhuthaganas of Lord Shiva worshipped the Lingam every night. They decided to construct a temple there. But Lord Shiva told them that they must complete the temple in a single night. Bhuthaganas agreed and started the construction. When the foundation was completed, Lord Vishnu came there, disguised as a cock and crowed to mislead the Bhuthaganas. The Bhuthaganas, fearing that dawn had approached, left the work unfinished. Sri Rama, during his search for Sitha, performed tharpana for Jadayu here. Another legend is associated with Vilwamangalam Swamiyar. One day he visited this place and realised the presence of Lord Shiva and identified the Shiva Linga installed by Parasurama. He started worshipping the Linga and Lord Mahadeva appeared infront of him and told him to start poojas there. Pottayil Ilayathu, Thottathil Nambiar and Idamana Nampoothiri made proper arrangements for Shiva Pooja and Vilwamngalam started the pooja. But there were no vessels to offer Nivedyam. So Vilwamangalam used a Kavungin Pala  aracanut leaf  to offer Nivedyam. Even today the nivedyam is offered in Kavungin Pala and is called Palanivedyam. Later Vilwamangalam and his associates   Ilayathu, Nambiar and Nampoothiri   constructed a temple but it was destroyed by flood in AD 1343. During the monsoon season the whole region gets flooded and the Shivalinga gets submerged in water. So the Ooranma Nampoothiris were decided to construct a small temple on the bank of the river inorder to perform poojas during monsoon season. This temple is called Bala Kshetram. It is a fact that though unfinished in nature, this temple has withstood many a flood and still stands as an enigma to the architects, regarding its foundation and structure. The Travancore Devaswom Board authorities constructed a temple structure here some years ago. but the Deva Prasna conducted later revealed that constructon of the temple structure is against Lord Shiva's wish.  The Shiva Linga faces east. There is a Nandi prathishta infront of the temple. There is only one pooja daily. From Makaram 1 to Medam 1 only athazha pooja is performed and on other days only nivedyam is offered. Shivarathry in Kumbham, Utsavam in Meenam, Vavu Bali in Tulam and Karkkidakam are the festivals. Dhara and Rudrabhishekham are the main offerings.  The most important festival of Aluva temple is the Maha Shivarathry in Kumbham  February March . There is no other place in Kerala where Shivarathry is celebrated on such a grand scale as in Aluva. The Shivarathry festival is a colourful celebration and devotees stay away the whole night in prayer and pay homage to their ancestors. The celebration of Shivarathry in Aluva is as famous as the festivals like Ashtami at Vaikom, Pooram at Thrissur etc. The sand bank is extensive and the pilgrims running into several thousands congregate here. People belonging to all classes, castes and creeds assemble for this festival, some for worship, some for merchandise and some for sight essing. There are rows of sheds built where merchants exhibit every kind of merchandise for sale. On the night of Shivarathry pilgrims keep awake and recite the puranas. There are shows, dances etc. meant for keeping the pilgrims awake throughout the night. In addition to the observance of Shivarthry rites, most of the pilgrims offer Bali  sacrifice  to their ancestors in the morning succeeding the holy night. A dip in this river at the Brahmamuhurtha after observing the rituals of Shivarathri is considered very sacred. A fair is also organised for a month from the Shivarathri day. Daily Ezhunnallippu of the deity atop a caparisoned elephant, a procession known as Dikvijayam is conducted on the third and fourth days, and pallivetta ceremony on the fifth day. The festival concludes with the Aarattu on the next day of Shivarathry.  There is an Ayyappa temple near the Temple. The Aluva Sree Krishna   Balarama temple, Aluva Adwaitha Ashramam and Aluva palace are situated on the opposite bank of Mahadeva temple.  To see the ariel view of the temple go to Wikimapia page.

According to the legend he was not able to reach the Vaikom temple for worship because of his ill health and hence, the Deity of Vaikom temple   Lord Vaikathappan  appeared in his Upasana Homagni.The Antharjanam  wife of that Brahmin  discovered the Shivalingam while cleaning the Homakunda.While cleaning the Homakunda the Shivalinga was hurt and a small hole was made on the top of the Linga and it started to bleed. The Brahmin realised the presense of Lord Shiva. Sandal paste was applied on the Linga and he lightened a Neyvilakku  ghee lamp  infront of the Linga. The temple was constructed later and it stands presently as the top center of the village. There seem to have been seven ooranma families  owners  of the temple. The present ooranma families include Pattamana Illam, Ettikkada Illam, Rishi Illam, Marangattu Illam, Panthalloor Illam, Ramalloor Perumpadathikkadu Illam and Neithasseri Illam.

The cabin is well protected with granite stones and this is one of the specialities that is worth mentioning. A lamp is lighted everyday in front of this, before the other main lamps are lighted. A serpent is believed to be sitting in front of this to safeguard the place.      There is also a well, with a continuous and everlasting spring with cool water.

It has always been a center for learning Rig Veda with many experts resident in the village. Education in the Rig Veda takes nearly seven years and the coaching was always associated with the temple.

Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya Swami has described Kumaranalloor Devi temple as one among the Pancha mahakshetrams five main temples  in India where you will feel the full presence of Devi and he has given the first position to this temple.   Goddess Kathyayani is the presiding deity in this temple. This deity is worshipped in five different forms   as Saraswati ,Lakshmi,Parvathi,Durga and Vana Durga.Kumaranalloor is an ancient cultural center and is one among the 32 Brahmin gramams made by Lord Parasurama.This place was known as 'Thingalkkadu', before the temple came into existence. Later the name 'Thingalkkadu' changed and later came to be known as 'Indu kananam'.In some ancient scripts, the temple is described and known as Mahishari kovil  temple . This temple has yielded an inscription assigned to 11th century A.D. Local traditions indicate that this was a Siva temple, later converted to Durga temple.That is the reason for visiting the Shiva Shrine before visiting Kumaranalloor Amma  Kumaranalloor devi temple is considered as one of the most important devi temples among the 108 durgalayas  devi temples  in Kerala made by Lord Parasurama. It is said to be more than 2400 years old, as per historical and mythological evidences as well as other sources of information.Devotees consider this temple equivalent to Madhura Meenakshi Temple.  Cheraman perumal was the ruling emperor of Kerala when the construction of a temple at Udayanapuram to install the idol of goddess durga began; while he commenced the construction of another temple at Thingalkkadu  which is later known as kumaranalloor  to install the idol of lord Kumara or Subramanya. Mean while a disturbing incident took place at Meenakshi temple, Madurai in Tamilnadu. The gem studded nose ring of devi was stolen or was missing. The King ordered an enquiry. At the same time, he ordered to kill the priest of the temple unless he could solve this problem with in 41 days. Because, the nose ring would not be misplaced without his knowledge. However, the priest was innocent. He was confused and perplexed in this dilemma. He took refuge at the feet of devi.  As days and weeks progressed, the grief stricken priest spent his days and nights crying and praying. On the night of the 40th day, he slept at the doorsteps of temple, meditating and contemplating his fate that his life would reach an end on the next day. However, he had a dream that night. Devi appeared before him and ordered him to quit the place at once. The perplexed and bewildered priest winked his eyes. He had seen a thejas  divine light  moving forward. He followed it without being aware of where he was going. The thejas divine light  led him a long distance and finally reached the place which latter became known as Kumaranalloor. At Kumaranalloor, the temple was under construction to install the idol of lord Subramanyan or Kumaran.  The thejas entered into the sreekovil sanctum sanctorum  of the temple. Moreover, it was at the prathista time  suitable time of installation  that the thejas entered the sreekovil. Then there was an asareeri  an inerporeal and divine voice , 'kumaranalla ooril', meaning, 'this place is not for kumara'. This is, kumari's or devi's place. Hence got the name Kumaranalloor. Perumal was disappointed and frustrated. He travelled to Udayanapuram to install the idol of Kumara, at the temple, which was under construction. On the way, Perumal encountered some obstacles but finally managed to reach Udayanapuram and install the idol of Subramanian at the sreekovil of the temple.  Later, Perumal returned to Kumaranalloor with the devi's idol and began the preparation for installing it there. Yet another thought striked him that the idol has to be changed. There was an idol lying in water at vedagiri a near by place. Perumal brought the idol from vedagiri. Maharshi Parasurama had supposedly made and worshipped the idol in past. At the time of installation, a brahmin sage with matted hair, came and entered the sreekovil and installed the idol in a second. As soon as the installation of idol was done he vanished. To this date people believe that the brahmin sage was Maharshi Parasurama. The brahmin priest, who followed the thejas from madurai, became the priest of the temple. His residence is known as Madurai illam. His successors worship the devi even today.  The architecture of the temple is notable for the unique structure of the nalambalam and sreekovil both of which have been built in the sreechakra style  ring like object with a handle, which is placed in the right hand of the devi . This kind of architecture is rarely found in temple architecture.The temple is situated in area of 15,000 square metres. The main gopuram  entrance  of the temple faces towards the east direction, and high walls surrounding the temple with other three gopurams  entrance  in each direction  south, west   north .  While entering the temple, the temple view presents a divine picture. Getting into the temple through the main gopuram one can see the golden dhwajom  flag staff  and the balickal pura with carvings of many sculptures including those of Ganapathy and Shiva and other saints on pillars. Inside the nalambalam, sreekovil and the main mandapam are surrounded by paths made of carved stones. The temple of Shiva is on the right side of the main sreekovil. Bhadrakali temple is situated on the south of the temple along with the full stretched surrounding path on carved stones for the whole temple.   Murals Mural paintings in Kumaranalloor temple are precious and rare. The outer walls of the sreekovil are decorated with paintings showing the different styles of gods, goddesses, and incidents from great epics like Ramayana and Mahabharatha. Natural colours and medicinal plants were used to colour the murals.  Devi is unique and is made of  Pathalanjanshila soft black stone .It is believed that Lord Parasurama worshipped this idol for thousand years and then immersed it in the Mokshasarassu in Vedagiri near Ettumanoor.Later Cheraman Perumal brought the idol from there and Parasurama installed it in this temple.The idol has four hands with Shamgha Chakra Varada Kadi Bandham.Since this idol is made of soft black stone there is no Vedi Vazhipadu fire works  and Chandanam Charthal Sandal cream pasting  in this temple.Instead of sandal, Manjal turmeric powder  is used and hence the main offering in this temple is Manjal Abhishekam.Manjal Abhishekam is also used to strengthen the idol.     This Mahadeva shrine is believed to be one among the108 Shivalayas made by Sage Parasurama.It is the Ambilikkadu temple given in the famous 108 Shivalaya Nama Sthotram.At first in Kumaranaloor only Shiva temple was existed and Cheraman Perumal built the Devi temple along side of Shiva temple. Here Shiva is as important as Devi.Shiva has also full poojas daily.It is the custom that before offering prayers to Devi  everybody has to offer prayers to Lord Shiva.Dhara and Koovala Bilwa  maala are the main offerings.   Manibhooshnan or Shastha is located on the left side of the Namaskara Mandapam.  Neerajanam and Pushpanjali are the main offerings to Shastha.   Aalinkal Bhagavathy idol is located near the South Gopuram.The idol of  Bhadra Kaali is on the bed of  a Baniyan tree hence the name Aalinkal Bhagavathy . Guruthy and Raktha Pushpanjali are the main offerings.   Sarppakkavu is located near the North Gopuram.Noorum Palum and Aayilyam Pooja are the main offerings.  There is a special rule followed to visit Devi.Above Slokam points to that rule.Deevotees must enter into the temple Thirumuttam through the East Gopuram.Then offer prayers to Devi by standing infront of the Golden Dwaja.Also offer prayers to Ashtadikpalakas in the boottom of the Dwajam, Simha lion  Vahanam on the top of the Dwajam and Ganapathy on the pillar near to the steps of Balikkalppura.Then start your Pradakshinam through the Pradakshina Veedhi path .Then enter into the Nalambalm of the Shiva shrine and offer prayers to Lord Mahadeva.After completing three Pradakshinams to Shiva shrine enter directly into the Nalambalam of Devi temple through the door near to Thidappally.Then the devottes must offer prayers to Lord Manibhooshanan on the pillar of Namaskara Mandapam.Then its time to see the beautiful and powerful idol of Sree Kumaranalloor Bhagavathy in the huge rectangular Sreekovil.After offering your prayers to Devi do six Pradakshinams inside the Nalambalam and then leave the Nalambalam through the Valiyabalikkalppura.Then start the Pradakshinam from Aanakkottil and offer prayers to Aalinkal Bhagavathy,Rakshass and Nagadevathas and complete your Pradakshinam.   Adi Shankara, Vilwa Mangalathu Swamiyar, Thirumala Naykkan, Melpputhoor Narayana Bhattathiri, Kurooramma, Kunjan Nambiar, Swathi Thirunal Maharaja and Mahatma Gandhi were ardent devotees of Kumaranallooramma. All of them visited the temple and offered their prayers to Devi.

The story goes that the Gods in these two temples, greatly charmed by the beauty of the Devi returning after her Karthika bath. They came out of the temples, got over the compound walls, and stood there looking amorously at the seductive figure of the passing Devi, and the temple priest who ran helterskelter in search of the Gods, finally met them on the walls at the southern end of the temples. Thenceforth, during Karthika, puja is performed over the walls of these temples. The display of lights in the evening, called Karthika Vilakku, is the highlight of this celebration.

Set amidst a vast campus, the temple enshrines the syncretic image of Sankaranarayana, whose left half shows the attributes of Vishnu and the right half that of Siva. It is a temple complex, built of granite and has a number of granite sub shrines.    Built on a circular plan, the temple, facing east is an example of eka tala vimana, but it is approached through an impressive balikkal mandapa associated with sculptured columns, four in numbers with beautiful images of the late Vijayanagara or Nayak plastic tradition. Here there is a definite predominance in the use of granite, the nalambalam, namaskara mandapa and other subsidiary structures are all built of this variety of stone.    The temple was renovated undoubtedly in M.E. 614  A.D. 1439  as can be gathered from the vatteluttu inscription  Travancore Archaeological Series I, pt. XVI, pp 421  engraved on the west base  kumuda of the adhishtana  of the central shrine. According to the text of the inscription the temple and the mandapa were built in stone and the central shrine having been covered with copper plates in that year itself. The Kumbhabhisheka was performed by the King Sri Vira Rama Marthandavarman Tiruvadi of Jayatunganadu and Kilpperur illam. It appears from the epigraph that the roof was covered with copper plates, but at present it carries a roof made of older small tiles which are not in vogue today. The other dated inscription, engraved on the balikkallu is very much damaged but the date, Kollam 782  A. D. 1607  is discernible. Perhaps, the balikkal mandapa was added to it in this year by a private individual Kumaran Kandan of Era nadu. The sapta matri bali stone bears the donative record  Travancore Archaeological Series VI, pp 83  of another individual, Madhavan Sankaran.    The principal shrine is a sandhara vimana. The entire bahya bhitti is in stone and has usual decorative elements, simple and subdued. It has two functional doors, one on the east and the other on the west. This wall is also relieved with kudya stambhas associated with pushpa potikas, ghana dvaras and false niches with sala sikhara.    The circular shrine encloses a square garbha grha  srikovil  made of granite. It has its own flight of steps and is encircled by a row of twelve columns along the inner ambulatory.    Other structures within the nalambalam include Ganapathi shrine facing west just south east of the Srikovil, the covered Mathrusala containing the sapta matri bali stones on the south side of the srikovil, the well on the north east corner and the thitappalli in the south east corner.    As stated earlier, the srikovil is covered with small tiles, while the pyramidal roof of the namaskara mandapa is covered with Mangalore pattern tiles.    Both the valiambalam and nalambalam are of stone with tiled roof on woodwork. The valiambalam leads to the agramandapam which contains the large balikkallu framed by four ornamental granite pillars with carved sculptures. Particular mention has to be made of the large human size sculptures of Garuda and Hanuman. The rectangular agramandapam is enclosed by wooden slats for the major portion with two door openings on to the sides. There is a wooden sculpture of Ananathasayi Vishnu on the architrave above the main door leading to the valiambalam from the agramandapam. Beyond the nalambalam, on its outer periphery is the Vilakku madom structure circumambulating the nalambalam.    Outside the nalambalam are the Dhwajam  the flagmast  and the Anapandal  the elephant portico  on the eastern side culminating in the dvara sala. The Sastha shrine is located on the south west side while Bhagavathi, Nagaraja and Yakshi are accommodated on the north west side of the outer prakara.    Rituals    Daily rituals consist of five poojas, followed by Sribali. Annual festival of ten days' duration is in Medam starting from Uthrattathi asterism. Prior to the start of the Utsavam there is a tradition of Urul Varavu  Sayana Pradakshinam  by members of 8 to 12 karas in the vicinity of the temple. Also from 2nd to 9th day of the festival there is a Gaja pradakshinam inside the nalambalam with the thitampu of the Lord on the elephant. These two traditions are unique in the Navaikkulam temple.    The tantra of the temple rests with Kulakkada Nampi Madom.    The temple was once very prosperous and owned large properties and there was even 'pathayams' for grain storage in the temple. A copper plate in the Trivandrum Museum dt 1522 A. D. refers to the entrusting of the administration the temple to the Akavur Mana by the people. When Temple entry proclamation was made in erstwhile Travancore state in 1936 A. D., the temple authorities had evinced lot of opposition. A unique stone inscription of the proclamation was erected in the West nada entrance to the temple. Subsquently the temple administration was taken over by the Government culminating in the seizure of the copper plates covering the srikovil and many of its wealth. The temple is now managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board.      On the topic of stone inscription erected to commemorate the temple entry proclamation, Mr. S K Suresh writes . . .  For a perspective on this, the structure was built and the expenses met by my late father Komalezhathu Karunakaran who was then, a Deputy Registrar posted at Navaikulam. He engaged local artisans who chiseled and hammered the structure into a piece of art. Many people have said that my father, like many others, may have felt the resonance of the Proclamation which heralded a new era. The inspiration to do what he did, came from the legacy of his uncle Shri. T K Madhavan  Vaikom Satyagraha , who was a source of influence during his formative years.  The stone monument was moved to its present location with the widening of the highway some years ago. A niche for lighting lamps was added later partially obfuscating the inscription bearing my father's name. Traces of the inscribed name could still be seen in the pictures.

Rameswaram is an interesting temple both from the standpoint of its association with          Rama and from a structural standpoint. A. huge temple in the island of Rameswaram  reached          via the Pamban bridge across the sea , Rameswaram is known for its long ornate corridors  Legend has it that Rama worshipped Shiva in the form of a Shiva Lingam          made of earth by Sita, while returning to Ayodhya.           entrusted with the task of bringing an image of Viswanathar from Benares.

Architecture and History  This temple, spread over an          area of 15 acres , has lofty gopurams, massive walls and a collossal Nandi. Rameswaram          also boasts of a 4000 feet long pillared corridor with over 4000  pillars, supposedly          the longest in the world.  The carved granite pillars are mounted on a raised          platform. What is unique about this corridor is that the rock is not indigenous to the          island and it was brought in from elsewhere in Tamilnadu across the sea. The eastern          Rajagopuram towers to a height of 126 feet and it has nine levels.  The Western          Rajagopuram, though impressive is not as tall as the Eastern one. The stuccoed image of          Nandi is about 18 feet tall and 22 feet in length.  It is believed that the ancient shrine was housed in a thatched hut until the 12th          century and that the 1st ever masonry structure was built by Parakrama Bahu of Sri Lanka.          The Setupathy rulers of Ramanathapuram completed the rest of the temple. Some of the          temple vimaanams resemble the Vimaanams of the Pallava period. Much of the additions were          carried out between the 12th and the 16th centuries. The long corridor  3rd prakaram           dates back only to the 18th century.

This temple has received royal patronage from several kingdoms  Worship  Six worship services are carried out each day, the first          being at 5am. Special worship services are carried out every Friday.

Theertham  Water springs   There are 36 Theerthams in Rameswaram of          which 22 are in the temple and these waters are said to possess medicinal properties.          Bathing in these is considered to be of great significance. The Agni theertham refers to          the ocean while the Koti theertham is located within the temple itself.   Other points of interest  The Gandamadana parvatam  hill  provides a          commanding view of the island. It also bears a shrine said to bear the footprints of rama.          Dhanuskoti  struck by a ravaging cyclone in the 20th century  is the          easternmost tip of the island, where legend has it that Rama with the tip of his bow          destroyed the bridge that he had built between the island and Srilanka, during his          victorious return.

Kadappattoor Mahadeva Temple is the important landmark of this village. Devotees can reach this temple either through Kadappattoor bridge near Pala Kottaramattam Municipal Bus Stand or through Pala Catheedral Church   Kadappattor Temple road near to Pala Valiyapalam  town bridge .  The legends of Kadappattor temple is aasociated with Sage Gauna. According to legends the Meenachil river starts from the Kamandalu of Gauna Maharshi like the river Kaveri from Agasthya Maharshi's Kamandalu. Hence this river got the name Gauna Nadi. Gauna Maharshi filled his Kamandalu with Sapthanadi Theertham  water from the 7 holy rivers   Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswathy, Sindhu, Narmmada, Godavari and Kaveri . A beautiful idol of Lord Subrahmanya was also kept in his kamandalu. He was eagerly waiting for the Darshan of Lord Sree Rama in his return journey to Ayodhya after killing Ravana. Sree Rama was accompanied by large number of devotees like Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Hanuman and Angada in the Pushpaka Vimana. So Maharshi Gauna could not see Lord Sri Rama and Sita Devi properly. So the angry Gauna threw the kamandalu away and the idol of Subrahmanya Swami came out. These incidents occured on a hill and since then the hill is known as Kudamuruttimala. This flow of water became a river and thus the present Gauna nadi was formed. Along wih the flow of the water, the idol was carried away to the Vishnu temple in Kidangoor and was later installed in a new sreekovil. This is the present Kidangoor Subrahmanya Swami Temple. So the water in Gauna river is as holy as the Sapthanadi Teertham.  Later Sree Rama and Sitha Devi gave darshan to Gauna Maharshi. Rama advised Gauna Maharshi to continue his Tapas and gave him a beautiful idol of Lord Shiva. Gauna Maharsi then started his journey along the river bank and atlast reached a beautiful village and decided to stay there. He started worshipping Lord Shiva there. The local people were his ardent devotees and they provided him all assistance for Shiva pooja. Hence Gauna Maharshi named this place as 'Kadappetta ooru'. Later Gauna Maharshi went to Shivaloka. After that this place became a great forest. This place is now famous as Kadappattor and the idol of Shiva worshipped by Gauna Maharshi is now famous as Lord Kadappattoorappa.  The emergence of Kadappattoor Mahadeva temple is a wonderful incident. After thousands of years, the idol of Shiva was discovered by a woodcutter named Madathil Paachu Nair from inside a large Athi  Country Fig   Ficus Glomerata  tree on the banks of Meenachil river on 14th July 1960 while he was cutting fire wood. The day was quite unusually stormy with deafening thunder bolts. When half of the tree was cut, the tree fell to the opposite side. Pachu Nair got quite frightened and became unconscious as the tree fell to one side and the stone idol of Lord Shiva appeared from that. The news of appearance of a beautiful Shiva idol from the tree spread like wild fire through central Travancore and people flocked to see the idol. Later a temple came up with the efforts of Bhaktas. Initially the temple had a unique architecture resembling North Indian temples. Gradually Kadappattoor has become an important pilgrimage center in Kottayam district.  The Devaprasnam conducted in the temple revealed that Lord Mahadeva is unsatisfied with the architecture of temple. Hence the temple authorities decided to renovate the temple and consulted Brahmasree Kanippayyoor Krishnan Nampoothirippad to remodel the temple structure. The renovation works were completed in 2006 and Naveekarana kalasam was performed in March. Now the temple has a three storied big rectangular sreekovil with copper covered pyramidal roof and golden thazhikakkudam. The sreekovil walls are decorated with sculptures. The namaskaramandapam also has a copper covered pyramidal roof and golden thazhikakkudam.  The main speciality of this temple is the idol of Lord Shiva. The stone idol of Lord Shiva is noteworthy and is unique. This is the only Shiva temple in Kerala where Lord Shiva is worshipped in a Swaroopa Vigraha  idol . In all other Shiva temples Lord is worshipped in Linga form.  Kadappattoor temple is an important Idathavalam  pilgrimage shelter  for the Sabarimala pilgrims. Thousands of pilgrims visit the Kadappattoor temple, every year, on their way to Sabarimala. Elaborate arrangements are provided for the pilgrims by the temple authorities. Alangad Sangham, a major participant of famous Erumely Pettathullal  a devotional dance, performed by the pilgrims  will rest here for a day on their way to Erumely. They will perform the Paanaka Pooja at this temple on Dhanu 26th  January  .  The Nagagandhi tree near the western gopuram attracts the devotees. This tree is very rarely found in temple compounds. You can see a small Shiva Linga inside the flower. Another speciality of this temple is that the Arattu kadavu is situated very close to the Eastern gopuram. People belonging to all religions are allowed to enter into the temple.  Ganapathy, Ayyappa, Nagadevathas, Bhagavathy  Badrakali  and Brahma Rakshass are the upadevathas of Kadappattoor temple.  Annadanam  especially on 14th day of every month  is the main vazhipadu of this temple.

The sanctum has been designed so that the              rays of the setting sun illuminate the face of the deity.  Legend has it that Vishnu vanquished the demons Kesa and Kesi , hence              the name Aadi Kesan  and took abode on the coils of Aadi Seshan here at Tiruvattaar. Kesi              took on the form of the Tamraparani river. Shiva is believed to have taken on 12 forms to              witness the battle between Vishnu and Kesi, and worship Vishnu.

Located nearby is Drakshaaraama, one of the five well known pancharaama shrines dedicated            to Shiva in Andhra Pradesh.  Kotipalli or Kumararama is regarded as one of the              tie together the five Pancharama temples dedicated to Shiva.  Koti Palli or Koti Theertham is located at confluenece            of the river Godavari with the sea. At the origin of the river is the Tryambakeshwar Jyotirlinga shrine in Maharashtra.            The river Godavari is revered as one of the gifts of nature and is held in great regard            both at its origin Triambakeshwar and at its confluence with the ocean. Thus, worship at Someswaram            or Kotipalli is closely associated with a ritual bath in the river Godavari.  Someswaram is rich in legend and tradition. Shiva is worshipped here as            Someswara or Koteeshwara and Parvati as Rajarajeswari. The Mahasivaratri  Legend has it that the moon God Chandra was cursed by Daksha            to lose his brilliance and that he was relieved of his curse after he offered worship to Shiva            at Koti Theertham at the mouth of the river Godavari. This legend is very            similar to the one held at Somnath Jyotirlinga            shrine in Gujarat. It should also be noted that Draksharama              one of the pancharaama shrines, is associated with the legend of the destruction of  the            For time immemorial it has been believed that a ritual bath in the river Godavari            at Kotipalli is symbolic of a new beginning in life, a change in direction. Legends            illustrating this symbolism have a common theme, that of forgiveness of heinous sins            The most classic of these legends is that of Ahalya Indra saapa            vimochanam. This legend occurs in the grand epic Ramayana. Gowtama believed to be one of            the foremost rishis of ancient India was married to Ahalya. Indra the king of the Devas            lusted after Ahalya and using a ploy, diverted Gowtama and assuming the            disguise of Gowtama led Ahalya in his embrace. An enraged rishi cursed his wife who            petrified into a rock immediately and was absolved of her curse by Rama  incarnation of            Vishnu . Indra the king of Devas was cursed with a life of disease. Legend has it that he            lived through his curse and performed severe penances  at the instance of Gowtama rishi             and finally was absolved of his curse and forgiven when his penance concluded with a            ritual dip in the Godavari river at Someswaram.

Also located in Kotipalli is the shrine to Sidheeswara Jagannatha              connected with the legend of Vaamana avataram. Legend has it that the devas prayed to            Vishnu at Kotithirtham requesting him to curb the power of the demon king Mahabali.            A ritual bath in the river is considered special in the month of Kartika,            and on Mahasivaratri day earlier on in the calendar year.

This shrine has a small separate chuttambalam abutting the Nalambalam of the main temple on the northern side. From there too one can enter the nalambalam which houses the main deities.    Inside the nalambalam, the Vettekkaran shrine is located in the northern side facing south. Of the major shrines inside the nalambalam the one dedicated to Shiva  Vadakkunnathan  is the largest. This is a circular eka tala structure with copper sheet roofing. The rear portion of the main shrikovil is utilized as the place for enshrining Parvathy. In front of the main shrikovil is a large square namaskara mandapa with a pyramidal roof. It has two concentric rows of stone columns; the inner row having four stout columns, heavily ornamented and the outer twelve. The ceiling has exquisite carvings.    The circular vimana in the middle accommodates Shankara Narayana. It is a dvi tala shrikovil, copper roofed but smaller than the northern main shrikovil. There is a small namaskara mandapa with 8 pillars but with no ornamental carvings.    The square dvi tala shrikovil with a mukha mandapa accommodates Sri Rama idol and is located at the southern end. The Sri Rama shrine has a spacious namaskara mandapa with 16 pillars decorated with carvings and ornamental woodwork.    All these structures have their basements  adhishtana  built of granite while the superstructure  bhithi  is of laterite, decorated with toranas and panjaras at intervals. All are copper sheet roofed. The exterior walls are painted with murals of fine craftsmanship.The temple has no dhwajastambha.    In between Vadakkunnathan and Shankara Narayana shrine is located Ganapathi, facing east.    In the outer praakara  perambulatory  enclosed by the puramathil  the boundary wall  are located a number of minor deities. There is a vilakkumaatom encircling the nalambalam on the outer periphery. Besides Goshala Krishnan, Vrshneeswaran and Rshabha shrines there exists the Parasurama shrine in a niche in the north eastern corner. Simhodaran  Parshadan  has his place to the rear of the nalambalam and the Shasta temple in Gaja prishta  apsidal  shape in the south west corner facing east. In front of the Sri Rama temple  in the outer praakara  is located the Samadhi of Adi Shankara Bhagavadpada.    Traditions.    Traditions have built strong ties with this temple and Mount Kailas which is considered the abode of Shiva. Sage Parasurama invited the Lord to Kerala, the new land strip he won over from the oceans. A literary work ascribed to the 16th century, \"Thenkailanathodayam\" authored by Neelakanthakavi, narrates the legend in detail. The Sree Moolasthanam near the western gopuram is considered the sacred place where the Lord of Kailasa manifested to the sage. The idol of Vadakkunnathan is perpetually covered in a mound of ghee, which is the main offering to the deity. The analogy of Mount Kailas is extended further by comparing the mound of ghee to the snow clad peaks of the Himalayas. The legend is indicative of the entry of Shaivism in the land. The pratishtas of Sri Rama and Shankaranarayana signify the advent of Vaishnavism, later in time, and the compromises between the two factions.    Preceding the shaiva entry, the temple was a worship center of the Jainas, as pointed out by some scholars. The Rshabha shrine might be a carryover from the Jaina period. Rshabha Deva is one of the Jain Thirthankaras. The custom of worshipping this deity is also unique in that devotees throw threads torn from their dress at the shrine and clap their hands.    The temple is also connected with the life of Adi Shankara. The legends proclaim that he was born to his parents after they beseeched Vadakkunnathan. Adi Shankara, after his earthly mission of propagating Advaita philosophy, is said to have shed his mortal body in Thrissur. Each of the four ashrams established by Adi Shankara  Badri, Puri, Dwaraka and Sringeri  has a representative ashram here in the town; the Vadakke madam, Natuvil madam, Idayil madam and Thekke madam. Of these the Idayil madam merged with the Thekke madam. Vadakke madam became the Brahmswom madam. The other two remain as such   the swamiyar madams.    Right from the entry point to the temple, there is a customary order to be observed for worshipping the deities of this temple.  The temple at Peruvanam which has many similarities with this temple also observes such a practice . Besides the deities of this temple, obeisance is paid to some of the temples in and around Thrissur.    The order of darsanam inside the nalambalam is Vadakkunnathan, Parvathy, Ganapathi, Shankaranarayana and Sri Rama in a straight line and repeating the same twice. Only for the third round is there the circular perambulation for the latter two shrines of Shankaranarayana and Sri Rama.    There are no annual utsavams or other celebrations in this temple except for Shivarathri. Even during Shivarathri celebrations, the deity is not taken out in procession.    The temple opens at three in the morning and closes at about 11.30 a.m. after the morning rites. For the evening worship it opens at five and closes at 8.30 p.m. Daily five poojas are the order of the day here but no Shribali or Sri Bhoothabali is observed. The Thantri of the temple is from Puliyannoor Mana.    Historicity.    The antiquity of the temple dates back to the eleventh century as can be affirmed from the probable date of the inscription on the vrtta kumuda  moulding of the basement . Engraved in characters of 11th century, it refers to the gift of stones  in adhishtana  by one Sattan Suvaran Mullaippalli  Annual Report of Indian Epigraphy 1970 '71, No. 73 .    The temple can even claim greater antiquity, in view of its association with the group of discarded Sapta matrkkal images ascribable to at least the 9th century.    Another inscription assigned to the 12th century, mention the Kottuvayiraveli Kacham  TAS  Vol VI  p 194  which testifies to the ascendancy of the Namboodiri Brahmins who framed regulations in regard to Vadakkunnathan Temple. This is the only Kachcham which contains provisions for controlling the rights of the tenants in Kerala. These Brahmins called Yogiyathiris, controlled the 'Sanketam' or well defined territory of the temple with sovereign powers. Even administration of criminal justice was handled by these Yogiyathiris and death sentence on criminals was being implemented in the name of Lord Shankaranarayana. The condemned criminals were taken out of the temple premises through the southern gopura  this gopura is seldom opened, except during the pooram festival . The practice of such form of temple administration was put to an end by the King of Cochin, Sakthan Thampuran. The Peruvanam Gramakshetra situated nearby also had a similar form of administration. Now the temple is administered by the Cochin Devaswom Board.    The temple has been a witness to power struggles between the Cochin Raja and the Zamorin of Calicut in the late mediaeval era. Still later Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan of Mysore occupied the temple for brief periods during their invasion and the now famous Ghee offering  vazhipadu  to Vadakkunnathan had its traditional moorings during this troubled period.    Highlights.    Thrissur Pooram celebrated annually in Medom  April May  is the grandest show of all temple festivals in Kerala. Of pomp and pageantry, of numerous caparisoned elephants adorning deities, of colorful parasols, of hundreds of drums  chenda , valantala, kombu, kuzhal and Ilathalam making up a grand orchestral ensemble lasting for hours and last but not the least, the unsurpassed elegance of pyrotechnics.    In the by gone days this pooram was a part of the historical Arattupuzha  Peruvanam  pooram. Some of the participating temples got detached from this and Sakthan Thampuran of Cochin later started the Thrissur pooram. Although this grand festival goes by the name Thrissur pooram and is celebrated in the Vadakkunnathan Temple premises, the Lord is but a mere spectator granting the premises and convenience for the festival. In fact it is the concluding celebration of utsavams of eight days duration of nine temples in the neighboring locality, which array in two groups.    The day pooram commences in the forenoon with the group led by Thiruvambadi  Bhagavathi  after paying obeisance at the Shree Moolasthana, enters the Matilakom, circumambulates the Vadakkunnathan and exit through the southern gopuram. At noon the Paramekkavu  Bhagavathi  group enters through the eastern gopuram and takes position near the Koothambalam inside the temple court yard, where Elenjithara Melam takes place.  On 7th of June 2001 this tree fell down . Even though Chembukkavu Bhagavathi forms part of this group, she gets out through the western gate towards Moolasthanam when alone Chendamelam will be played.    At the close of the day pooram both the groups coming out of the southern gopura array themselves face to face, in what is called as the 'March to the South'  Thekkottirakkam . The culmination of this is the 'changing of the parasols'  Kutamattom  atop the fifteen strong elephant herd on each group to the accompaniment of electrifying orchestra. This parade culminates around 2 a.m. at night after which gala pyrotechnics light up the sky.    The temple walls are a repository of mural paintings. The Shankaranarayana shrine has some exquisite panels from the Mahabharatha theme, executed in the 17th century. The Nandi mandapa in front of the main shrine has the figures of Shiva reclining on Vasuki, Shiva Thandava  Nrttanaatha , Mohini Yakshi etc. The corridor in front of Vadakkunnatha  leading one from Western gopura into Nalambalam  has on its northern side a large Nandi.    The Koothambalam of this temple is the largest among such structures in Kerala having a length of 23.5 metres and width of 17.5 metres The rangapeetam is 6.3 metre square. Ammannur Chakyar has the right to perform Kuthu and Kootiyattom here.    Epilogue.    True to its enviable location on top of a sprawling hill, the typical plan displaying almost all aspects of the Hindu temple of the Western Coast and the diversity of the various Shrikovil structures, the temple has been declared a National monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological sites and Remains Act.

The first of these ornate      temples dates back to 1032 CE, approximately the period in which the grand Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamilnadu  South      India  was built in the Dravidian style of architecture . The      Dilwara temples have been described as a dream in marble. Mount Abu   a popular hill      station, located in Rajasthan is on the Ahmedabad   Jaipur   New Delhi railroad, off of      Abu Road, the nearest railhead. Other attractions here include the Nakki lake, the Adhar      Devi temple, Achalgarh Shiva temple and the Gau Mukh Shiva temple.  P. Ramakrishnan       Mumbai, India  takes us on an illustrated tour of these temples.       known fact that the art   architecture of a country reflect its intensity of      religious devotion as well as economic prospreity, without which great   elaborately      carved temples could not have been raised.In every phase of Indian history,art        architecture found supporters in rich merchants and Princes who spend lavishly on      the  commemoration of their religious beliefs.Gujarat and Rajasthan,the traditional      centers of the merchants and Princes,also became centers of great architectural  According to the inscription Mt.Abu was basically a seat of      Jainism made its appearance only in 11th century.The first Jain temple of Dilwara,the      Vimala Vasahi was built in 1032A.D. by Vimala Shah,minister of Bhimadeva I. Besides the      famous temple at Abu,there are five temples of Neminatha at Girnar,built in honour of      is the earlier and more important of the temples here and  is  dedicated to the      first Jain Tirthankara, Adi Nath.  It stands in an open courtyard defined by 58      subordinate cells which contain small icons  duplicating the saint's image in the      main shrine.The plan of the temple   resembles that of Kashmiri Sun temple at      Martand.Elaborately columned porticoes surround the main shrine and front the cells lining      courtyard.The entire temple is carved out of  white marble.  According to the local legend before becoming the minister,the      Vastupala and Tejapala went on a pilgrimage carrying with them huge       wealth,which they decided to burry under a tree,but while digging they found       more gold.At this point Anupama Devi,wife of Tejapala advised them to build       temples at Satrunjaya and Girnar with their wealth.During their term in       office they heard about the holliness of Mt.Abu and decided to build a       temple there to Neminatha to commemorate their dead brother Luniga.  It is believed that when the eleborate and intricate carvings      finished,Tejapala asked the carvers to add greater delicacy to the floral       patterns by more chiselling,offering them reward in silver weighing as much       as the marble filed.Later Tejapala offered gold in weight to the marble if       it could be chiselled further.Whatever the truth there may be in the       story,there is no doubt that it must have taken a good deal of encouragement       to complete a monument of such beauty and refinement.      architectural plan of Vimala Vashi temple, built nearly 200 years      earlier ,nevertheless stands as the last of the monuments built in the Solanki style,which      occupation of Gujarat by the Muslims towards the end of 13th century.The       striking feature of the Tejapala temple is its dome which stands on 8       pillars.The pendant of the dome is a perfect gem;where it drops from the ceiling it looks  From the dome one's attention is diverted to the principal       Naminatha.There are in all 39 cells each containing one or more images. Most  of the      ceilings in front of the cells are highly ornamented..The reliefs in the  porticoes      of the cells depicts incidents from the life of Neminatha, his  marriage,deification      etc. The representation of the marriage pavilion in one  of the panels identifies the      scene and graphically portrays the cause of the       conversion of Neminatha who was betrothed to Rajimati,the daughter of the king of Girnar.      The Hathikhana or the elephant room next claims our attention.There are 10        elaborately carved elephants inside the cell.Formerly the elephants carried the idols      representing the members of Vastupala's family,but now they have disappeared. Behind the      elephants are 10 slabs,each bearing a male and female  figureson it   it is believed      In northern end,the 7th and 8th slab carry the figures of Vastupala with Lalitha Devi and      Viryta Devi and Tejapala with Anupama Devi,the guiding spirit behind this  venture of      Tejapala and is rightly described in the inscription as a \"flower of celestial      beauty,whose whole family was distinguished for prosperity, modesty, wisdom, decorum and   Indian Temple Architecture  Travel and Tourism   Festivals and Fairs  Legends   Glossary of Terms  ", "answers": [["mount abu , built in the nagara style are among the finest monuments of india . the first of these ornate temples dates back to 1032 ce , approximately the period in which the grand brihadeeswarar temple at thanjavur in tamilnadu south india", " ", "tejapala", " "], ["thanjavur in tamilnadu south india", " ", " ", " "], [" ", "adi nath", "[CLS] the temple is dedicated to whom ?

Thiruvanaya Navamukunda Temple, near Ponnani in Malappuram district is situated on the banks of the river Bharathapuzha. Thirunavaya was once the capital of Perumpadapu Swaroopam. It is  indeed the cradle of culture in northern Kerala. Holding immense historical importance, this is the place where 'Mamangam', a grand assembly of the rulers of Kerala was held once every 12 years, in olden times. This extravagant festival was held for the last time in 1755 AD. The famous and ancient Thirunavaya Temple, known throughout the country as an ancient teaching centre of the Vedas, was once plundered and destroyed by Tipu Sultan's army. It was the Zamorin who repaired the temple later.   This is the place were Nava yogis  Sathuvanathar, Saaloga nathar, Aadhinathar, Arulithanathar, Madhanga Nathar, Macchendira Nathar, Kadayanthira Nathar, Korakkanathar and Kukkudanathar  worshipped Vishnu. Vishnu gave darsan for Nava yogi. Hence this place is called  Thirunavayogi and later changed in to Thirunaavaya. In due course, 8 yogis attained moksha and the vigrahams worshipped by them also disappeared and as a result of this, the ninth yogi got dejected and stopped offering worship to Vishnu. When questioned by Perumal, he said that he was missing his companions and Perumal with his maya showed the 8 yogis. The 8 yogis agreed to stay there but said that they would be invisible to human eyes and the 9th yogi could feel their presence. In due course, the 9th yogi requested Perumal to make him also invisible. But Perumal insisted that the vigraham worshipped by the 9 th yogi must be kept there itself and Perumal blessed the 9 yogis saying that they could offer worship to Him at that place forever. Hence, what we see now is the vigraham worshipped by the 9th yogi.  Goddess Mahalakshmi and Gajendra  Indradyumna  used to offer lotus flowers for worshipping Perumal. As Lakshmi Devi would pluck the flowers for aaradhana daily before Gajendran, the elephant got dejected and approached Perumal and told that henceforth it had to go elsewhere to get lotuses for Perumal. As Perumal did not want his devotee to get dejected, He appeared before Goddess Mahalakshmi and Gajendran and said that Thayar could be with Him and accept the offerings made by Gajendran. Hence, this is the only divya desam, in Kerala which has a separate Sreekovil for Maha Lakshmi  Thayar .  It is a usual practice in Kerala temples that after installing an idol, the Sreekovil would remain closed for 7 days with the belief that the devas would offer pooja to the idol. In this temple, first a vigraham was installed and the Sreekovil was kept closed for 7 days. But when the doors opened, they were shocked to see the idol missing. They again brought another idol and the idol disappeared. This went on for 8 times and on the 9th time, out of curiosity, when they opened the temple doors before the scheduled time, they were shocked to see that the idol had descended into the earth upto the knee. To prevent further descent of the idol, They immediately chanted various mantras and saw to it that the idol did not descend further. It is believed that when the idol would descend into the earth, Kaliyuga will come to an end.  Thirunavaya is considered equivalent to Varanasi because of the presence of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma temples. It is a well known story that Markandeya was destined to die at th age of 16. When Lord Yama came to take his life, the little boy ran into this temple and prayed to Perumal to save him. Perumal appeared before the boy and gave him a Shiva linga for worship and advised the boy to escape from the backside entrance. He assured that Lord Shiva would take care of him. As soon as Markandeya escaped from the backside, Perumal placed a big stone and closed the way permanently and ensured that Yama could not enter the way. To this day, the door behind Perumal remains closed. Markandeya worshiped Shiva near to this temple and the place where Lord Shiva gave darsan to Markandeya and killed Yama, is now famous as the Truppangottu Shiva Temple   one among 108 Shivalayams.  The subdieties in this temple are Ganapathy and Lakshmi Bhagavathy. Thousands flock here on Karkkidaka vavu day to perform the pithrukriya rites for the departed souls.

Thiruvattar Sree Adikesava Perumal Temple is situated 6 km north east of Marthandam and 30 km north west of Nagercoil  in Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu . The temple is surrounded on three sides by rivers  Kothai,Parali and Thamirabarani . Paraliyar takes a turn in this place and it is called vattaru and when the temple of Adikeasav Perumal was created it came to be known as Thriuvattaru.   This Temple is older than Padmanabha Swamy Temple at Thiruvananthapuram. Its structure is similar to that of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The style and the architechture of this temple is taken as the sample to construct the Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The idol of Adikesava and Sree Padmanabha are installed in such a way that they face each other. The lord is lying on his snake couch and has to be viewed through three doors. We could see Lord Shiva near the Lord Adikesava Perumal inside the sannidhi.   Lord Brahma performed a Yaga without Saraswathi Devi and as a result of Saraswathi's angry, two asuras by name Kesan and Kesi emerged out of the Yagagni  sacrificial fire . They were troubling the three worlds. The Devas approached Vishnu and requested him to find a solution. Lord Mahavishnu in the form of Kesava Perumal fought with Kesan. Perumal threw Kesan who fell on top of Mahendragiri and Perumal blew His conch.Instantaneously, Adisesha wound himself around Kesan thus disabling the asura to move and immediately Perumal laid on Adisesha thus putting His weight. When the asura tried to get out of Adisesha's coils, Perumal made 12 Shivalingams to stand as guard around the asura and Perumal. These famous Shiva Temples are Thirumala, Thikkurussi, Thrupparappu, Thirunandhikkara, Ponmana, Pannippakam, Kalkkulam, Melankodu, Thiruvidaikkodu, Thiruvithamkode, Thiruppanrikkode and Thirunattalam. Even today, the worship to Lord Shiva on Sivarathiri day   The famous Shivalaya ottam   is said to be complete only when the devotee after visiting the 12 Shiva shrines ends his trip in the Perumal Temple.  Kesi who saw her brother defeated wanted to avenge and hence she along with her friend, Kothai took the form of rivers and encircled the temple with the intention of submerging the temple. At that time, it is believed that Bhoomi devi raised the temple . Hence, the temple is situated at a height of 55 feet from the ground level. The image of the Gopuram clearly indicates this. The rivers joined with Arabian Sea at a place known as Moovaatru mukham. The rivers were cursed by Perumal and they repented for their action. Perumal forgave them and had a dip in Moovaatru mukham. Even today, during Painguni utsavam, Perumal comes on golden Garuda and has dip in the river thus enacting the saapa vimochana incident.  In 1740 the men of the Nawab of Arcot looted this temple and the golden idol  ulsava vigraham . It was so heavy. He kept the idol along with rubbish in a lumber room. Every day, the idol would come on top and in spite of being tied down with ropes, the idol would come to the top. At that time, the Nawab's wife developed serious illness which could not be cured by anyone. Perumal appeared in the dream of the temple priest and ordered him to go to Nawab's palace and inform the Nawab that if the idol was returned, his wife would be cured of illness.

Thirumoozhikkulam temple is located in between Angamaly in Ernakulam district and Mala in Thrissur district. Thirumoozhikkulam is one among the 32 Brahmin gramams in Kerala. This is the place where Hareetha muni the son of Vishwamithra worshipped Vishnu.      The mythology behind the name of this place goes like this. Hareetha Maharshi did penance and meditation on the banks of river Poorna Periyar . Lord Mahavishnu got impressed by the dedication of the Maharshi and appeared before him on the beginning of the Kali yuga. Lord Vishnu gave some advices to Hareetha Maharshi to overcome the difficulties in Kali yuga. These advices are called \"thiru mozhi\" meaning sacred words. And there after this place got its name as \"thirumozhi kalam\"   kalam means place. Later Thirumozhikkalam became Thirumoozhikkulam.      This shrine is associated with legends from the Ramayanam. Legend has it that while Bharata the brother of Rama and Lakshmana, came to invite Rama, then in exile, to take over the reins of the kingdom, an angry Lakshmana suspecting Bharata's intentions intended to kill him; however, Bharata's innocence was very soon revealed, and then the two of them offered worship together at Tirumoozhikkalam. Worship is offered to Rama, Sita and Hanuman at this spot acknowledging their presence. No music is played during worship services here, unlike other temples. The annual festival which falls in the malayalam month of Makaram used to be an occasion of great festivity, with performances of koothu and Koodiyaattam for a 41 day period in the temple Koothambalam.      Inscriptions from the 11th century CE  Bhaskara Ravivarman  are seen in this temple. The Thirumoozhikualam Lekshmana Perumal Temple had a superior status and it had a command over the other local temples. It attracted most of the Tamil Vaishnavite pilgrims who visited ancient Kerala. The temple had a bylaw by name 'Moozhikkulam katcha' which applied to all other temples of Kerala.      Vakkay Kaimal, had a dream one night in which some mysterious person appeared before him and told him that four idols have been washed ashore and that these idols are to be consecrated at such and such places. The Kaimal being an ardent devotee hastened to the sea shore there lay four idols as indicated in the dream. They were duly installed in four temples as directed in the dream. Rama at Thriprayar. Bharata at Irinjalakuda, Lakshmana at Moozhikkulam and Shathrughna at Payammal. It is believed that worship at all these four temples on the same day is especially meritorious. In the Malayalam month of Karkidakam  July 15th to August 15th    the Ramayana Masa, thousands of devotees do this special pilgrimge, which is popularly known as Nalambalam Yatra   a pilgrimage to the four temples.      The temple was sacked by during Tippus invation, like the temple at Thiruvanjikkulam. The image of the presiding deity is in a damaged state . A silver kavacham or armour was made as a covering for the image; however soon after installation of the kavacham an attempt was made to steal it. Afterwards a Devaprasnam was conducted, which insisted that the Perumal wanted to be in that state only, he didn't want to hide the damage or replace the original idol. Since then it stays like that.      The 'Periya Thiruvaymozhi' composed by Nammazhvar praises the greatness of deity of Thirumoozhikkulam. The deity of this temple Lakshmanan is said to be kind to those who suffer and the wish of the devotees get fulfilled. Devotees vouch of their wish getting good children by visiting the temple which is also claimed to ail illness of heart.      There are idols of Shiva as Dakshinamoorthi south side  Ganapati, Sree Rama, Seetha, Hanuman Ayyappa, Sree Krishna  as goshala Krishnan  and Bhagavathy in this temple. There is an order in visiting the deities of this temple.

For the last one week, Thiruvananthapuram, the abode of Lord Sree Padmanabha and the capital city of Kerala is witnessing the veiled fortune around Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple same as a kid wondering when he sees the night sky crammed with stars for the first time. Nearly 1Lakh crores of wealth has been revealed form the undisclosed  aras   secret vaults  of the temple.      The divine concept of the then ruled Thiruvithamcore Maharajas, as they were none but descendents of the lord is shown in this context. The mammoth wealth that is accumulated by the Kings has been given to the temple. It is considered that the wealth was stored as a backup system, at the times of dearth. The ruler, at the period of scarcity will take the required wealth form the stored treasure and will use it for the sake of the country, just as a borrower to the lord Sree Padmanabha and must return it after the situation become normal. This significant concept reveals the relation between the Thiruvithamcoor Travancore  Kings and Lord Sree Padmanabha. Every thing were dedicated to lord and each kings adorned the name as  Sree Padmanabha Dasa . Where else in the Universe can see such a dedication.      In pasurams, Nammalvar refers Sree Padmanabhaswamy as \"Thamarai Manaalan\" and Thaayar  Mahalakshmi  of this temple as Sree Hari Lakshmi Thaayar.      This temple is located inside the Fort in the city of Thiruvananthapuram. Thiruvananthapuram is also called Syanandoorapuram. The main deity, Padmanabhaswamy is a form of Vishnu in Anananthasayanam posture  in eternal sleep of yognidra . This is an ancient temple and the city of Thiruvananthapuram The Revered Endless City  derives its name from the name of the presiding deity enshrined in the temple. Texts including the Puranas like Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Vayu Purana, Varaha Purana and Brahmanda Purana have references for this shrine. In Padma Purana there is reference to the temple of Anantasayanam, where the Lord Vishnu is having his yoganidra. It is also mentioned with Mathura, Venkatadri etc., as one of the well known Vishnu Temples. In the Skandapurana, Sethu Mahatmya, Brahmakhanda Chapter 52, verses 102 to 105, some of the most important places of pilgrimages are indicated, which includes Padmanabha. There is also mention in the Bhagavata purana  canto 10 chapter 79  that Balarama visited \"Syanandoorapuram\" in the course of his pilgrimage. An entire chapter named Anantapura Mahatmyam in Brahmanda Purana, is dedicated to this temple. It is also mentioned in the Mahabharata. It has been identified as one of seven 'Mukti Sthalas' in the 'Syanandoora Purana Samuchayam' and as one of the six seats of Narayana by Chaitanya Maha Prabhu of modern times. Tradition states that in this place, Lord Vishnu gave darshan to sages like Divakarmuni and Vilwamangalam Swamiyar.    According to the legends, the temple was set up by a Tulu Brahmin ascetic named Divakara Muni on the 950th day of the Kali Yuga. Divakara Muni, a great devotee of Vishnu, was doing penance and Tapas in 'Aatharta' desa. One day Maha Vishnu appeared before him in the form of a beautiful child. The Sanyasi was taken up with the charms of the divine child and requested him to stay with him. The child agreed but on one condition that the sage would never get upset with him. The Muni agreed and tolerated all the childish pranks of the little boy. But one day, while Divakara Muni was in meditation the child took the 'salagram', which he was worshipping and put it into his mouth and made such a nuisance of himself, that the Muni chastised him. The child immediately ran away and disappeared saying, \"if you wish to see me again You will find me in Anantankadu, the forest of Ananta\". The sage was inconsolable and followed the child. Finally, he reached a wooded area near the sea coast and saw the child vanishing into a hug ilippa bassia longifolia  tree. Immediately, the tree fell the ground assuming the shape of a recumbent Maha Vishnu. The divine form was nearly 13 km. long, having his head at Thiruvallam and its feet at Trippapur. Overawed by the majesty and the size of the divine form which manifested itself before him, the Sanyasi prayed that the Lord condense himself in size so that it would be possible for him to see Him within his limited field vision and offer puja. Accordingly, Lord Vishnu shrank in size and Divakara Muni offered pujas. The King constructed a temple there. Anachronisms exist as the temple is known to be of earlier origin. Hence it is concluded that it was a reconsecration that was carried out then by the King.      The same story is associated with Vilwamangalam too. Vilwamangalam Swamiyar was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Such was his bhakti that Vishnu appeared in the form of a small boy and stayed with the Swamiyar on the condition that if the Swamiyar got annoyed with the boy, the boy would immediately leave. Swamiyar accepted to this condition. Whenever the Swamiyar used to meditate, the boy would displace the idol of Vishnu. One day the boy took the Nivedyams prepared for the pooja and swallowed it. This annoyed the Swamiyar and he beat the boy with his right hand. Immediately the boy reminded the Swami that he had broken his promise and if he wished to see Him, he could do so at Ananthankadu. Then Swamiyar realised that the boy was Lord Vishnu itself. The repentant Swami started in search of the boy. He could hear only the sound of anklets and could see the foot prints of the boy. After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of Arabian Sea, he heard a pulaya lady threatening her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu, he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady from whom he enquired. He once again heard the sound of anklets and waist bell and suddenly a big Iluppa tree fell down and it got transformed into Ananthasayana form. The idol was so long that its head was in Thiruvallam  5 km away from east fort  and feet in Trippappur  8 km away from east fort, near Kazhakkuttam  and the middle part in Ananthankadu  where the present Padmanabhaswami Temple is situated . Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven and prayed Him to contract Himself. Accordingly, Perumal contracted His body. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga  salted mango pieces  in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. She was later gifted lands by Maharaja which can be found near the eastern entrance. Even today, the same nivedyam is offered to Lord but the coconut shell is now encased in gold.    Devotees must visit Trippapur, Thiruvananthapuram and Thiruvallam temples in a single day to get the full blessings of Padmanbha. Devotees can see the foot image of Padmanabha at Trippapur temple. In Trippapur and Thiruvananthapuram it is in the month of Meena that utsavam festival  takes place. Same day kodiyeetam flag hoisting  happens. The festival is for 10 days. Thruppapur Mahadeva and Padmanabhaswami have their aarattu  festive bathing  together at Sanghumugham beach. It is a beautiful site.      Maharaja of the erstwhile princely state of Travancore, did the last major renovation of the temple. The work on the temple was started in 1731 A.D. Raja Marthanda Varma, following his annexation of several small kingdoms into the Venad to enlarge it as the kingdom of Travancore dedicated his kingdom to the deity in 1750 A.D, and pledged that he and his descendants would serve the kingdom as Padmanabha Dasa, meaning 'servants of the Lord Padmanabha'. With this, Sri Padmanabha became the nominal head of the state of Travancore, assuming the title Perumal, the Emperor. The British Government saluted the Lord with 21 gun salute, a military tradition of colonial days, which was continued by the Indian Army until the abolition of the privy purses by Government of India with Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister. The royal insignia of the Lord, The Valampiri Shankhu or sinistral conch shell, served as the State emblem of Travancore and even continued so for some time after the re organisation of the States. Sri Padmanabha is still regarded as regional deity of Travancore.    The temple stands by the side of a tank, named Padma Theertham  meaning the lotus spring . The temple has a corridor with 365 and one quarter sculptured granite stone pillars with exquisite and beautiful carvings. An golden flag staff which is about 80 feet in height and circular in shape, holding at the top Garuda, the God's favourite riding bird is erected in front of the main entry from the 'prakaram'  corridor . In the sanctum sanctorum, Vishnu is in a reclining position over the Anantha or Adi Sesha, the serpent with his face pointed upwards, he is enjoying the smell emanating from the lotus held in his left hand, his right hand is hanging over Lord Shiva. Sridevi and Bhoodevi, two consorts of Vishnu stand by his side and the Brahma is seen on a lotus, which emanates from the navel of Vishnu. Goddess Lakshmi and Bhoomi, sages Bhrigu, Markandeya and assembly of celestials, Narada, all are made of a composition known as 'Katu Sharakara Yogam' which involves a highly complicated process and is uncommon even in Kerala from where it originates. Shiva of Shaiva Salagrama Shila sits under the right hand of Padmanabha. Thus the Trinity   Brahma, Vishnu, Maheswara representing creation, preservation and destruction   are seen together in the sanctum in a rare concept. The original idol made of Iluppa wood is replaced with a new one in A.D 1729 because a fire in the temple damaged the idol. The new idol is made up of 12008 salagramams that compose the reclining lord. They are special because they are from Nepal, from the banks of river Gandhaki and they were brought to the temple with all pomp and gaiety on elephant top. On top of them \"katu sharkara yogam\", a special ayurvedic mix, was used to give a plaster. The consecration was conducted by Tanthri chief priest  Tarananallur Padmanabharu Parameswararu in 1739 AD. The 18 feet long idol of Padmanabhaswamy is covered with gold and invaluable precious stones and the Anantha is covered with silver plates. The use of gold on many vital parts of the idol was discovered only in 2002. Since the idol was made of Katu Sharkara Yogam no abhishekham is carried out on this 18 feet long idol and are done on a Sheeveli idol. Hence the thick smoke from camphor, lamps and agarbathis over the centuries gave a black colour to the idol. It was during the cleaning up and restoration of a part of the idol that, the presence of gold was found.      In order to perform darshan and puja, one has to climb on a stone slab and different parts of the Vishnu s idol, namely, the face, the navel and the feet, are visible from three different door like openings. The ottakkal  single stone slab  mandapam in front of the idol is a single slab of granite and twenty feet square. Outside the inner shrine, but within the enclosures, there are smaller shrines dedicated to Krishna, Kshetrapala, Sasta, Narasimha, Vyasa, Siva, Ganesha, Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman.      This temple faces east and surrounded by massive fort walls. The area covered by its enclosures is about 7 acres. The temple has a seven tier gopuram. The foundation for this gopuram had been laid in 1566 and was rebuilt upto the fifth story during Marthanda Varma's period. Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma raised it to its present height and form much later, some time between 1758 and 1798 A.D. The Gopura is pyramidal in shape and built with granite and brick and resembles like the lofty Gopuras of the east coast temples. This tower is about 100 feet in height and has stories with window light openings in the centre of each of them. The stone basement of the tower is covered wit elaborate sculptures, and the masonry above with ornamental work of Puranic figures, the top having seven gold steeples or turrets. Underneath the gopura is the gateway leading to the principal temple well protected by a number of massive doors and guarded by sentries. Between the gateway and the inner shrine there is broad open corridor in the form of an oblong supported by 324 pillars and covered with terraced roof. On one side, it is 450 feet long a on the other side 350 feet. It is 25 feet broad. The two rows of granite pillars and the stone ceiling above are decorated with fine sculptures. Every piller has the figure of a Nayar girl bearing a lamp in the palm of her hands joined together and raised above her waist. The top of each pillar is surmounted by the head of a unicorn in the mouth of which is a loose ball of stone. At the four points of this oblong corridor, but not connected with it, stand four stone plat forms, from which people witness the God's procession during the important festivals in the temple. They are used on ordinary days for the reading of the Puranas or the recital of Puranic stories on special occasions by a class of people called chakkiars. On the south of the southern part of the corridor is a house dedicated to the performance of the Chief State ceremonies. North of the oblong is the cooking apartment of the feeding house attached to the temple.      Beyond this magnificent corridor or covered walk is the flagstaff of gold. South of this flagpost and connected with the corridor is the Kulasekhara mandapa, containing most impressive stone sculptures of the early eighteenth century. It is here that, Sanskrit scholars and priests chant Vedas during Murajapam. The Kulasekhara mandapa in particular is a storehouse of some of the best pieces of sculpture and contains representations of various deities, especially Vishnu and Shiva. The figure of Vishnu is a fine example of statuary art. It is in a sitting posture with Lakshmi on the left. The God holds in his hands the Shanka  Conch  and Chakra  wheel  and his other emblems. A towering canopy Made of a tree with numerous intertwined branches covered with flowers and fruits provide the background. Another interesting seated image is that of Vighneswara  Ganesha  with his portly belly and stout diminutive limbs. On his sides stand three Brahmin priests performing puja, which are masterpieces of realistic art. Various other Puranic scenes and figures are also depicted with scrupulous finish  Markandeya embracing Shiva, Krishna playing on the flute with the Gopis dancing the incarnation of Vishnu as Vamana  dwarf , Kaliyamardhana  Krishna trampling on the serpent, Kaliya , various scenes from the Ramayana such as the presentation of Rama and Lakshmana to Vishwamitra, the departure of Rama with his brother and wife to the forest, the abduction of Sita, the fight with Bali, Hanuman setting Lanka on fire and the fight with Ravana. The story of the Bhagavata is also depicted in small reliefs. Then there are trees, bushes, animals and birds such as parrots, squirrels and monkeys, all carved with remarkable life and grace. Between the flagstaff and the inner shrine is the space containing the altar. The inner shrine is rectangular in shape and consists of two stories and is ornamented with gables, unessential characteristic of the Kerala style of temple architecture. The outer walls of the central shrine are covered with mural paintings recently renovated depicting various scenes from the Puranas. The central shrine, with the halls and mandapas inside, are enclosed by a rectangular structure on the outside of which columns of lamps of brass  vilakkumatam  are fixed.      The Sree Krishna Temple is situated in the northern side and it is believed that this is the place where Vilwamangalam attained Moksha. This temple has a flag staff made of silver. Near to the golden flag staff of Padmanabha there is a huge idol of Lord Hanuman. The body of Hanuman is covered with butter. This butter will not melt even in hot days or even with the presence of fire and will not attract ants and insects. In the seventeenth centuary there occured a massive fire in the temple. At that time too the butter remained as such. The huge idol of Kshetrapala is located near to Hanuman. It is believed that the foot of Kshetrapala grows. That's why the foot portion of this idol is not covered.      Some of the constructional details of the temple stagger the imagination. The Sreebalipura, the magnificent rectangular corridor built of stone surrounding the main shrines, took 4000 stone artisans, 8000 labourers, 100 elephants and seven months to complete the work. And the temple  flagstaff, built of special teak, later encased in gold, came from a site 48 km. away without ever touching the ground a colossal feat performed by elephants.      There are many festivals related to this temple. The major festivals are bi annual. The Alpashy festival which is on October November and the Painkuni festival which is on March April, lasts for 10 days each. Utsavam begins with kodiyettam on first day. Pallivetta hunt  on nineth day takes place at a spot in front of the Sundaravilasam Palace and Vettakkorumakan Temple in Trivandrum fort, where an attack, was made on the life of Maharaja Marthanda Varma, whose devotion to the Lord found unique expression in his dedication of the state to Lord Padmanabha. These festivals culminate with the Aaratt  holy bath  procession to the Shankumugham Beach. The word Aarat refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The three deities  Sree Padmanabha, Narasimha Swamy and Lord Krishna  are carried in flower decked and aesthetically decorated Garuda Vahanas. The King of Travancore escorts the Aaratt procession by foot. Members of the princely family and armed Police contingents, with temple accessories also escorts the procession. The images of Sree Padmanabhaswamy, Sree Krishna and Sree Narasimha and Lords of Thrippappur and Thrivikramamangalam are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed poojas. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple as a procession in the light of traditional torches, thus marking the conclusion of the festival. The aarattu days are declared as local public holidays in Thiruvanathapuram.      Another annual festival related to Sree Padmanabha temple is the Navaratri festival. The idols of Saraswathi, Durga, and Murukan is brought to the Kuthira malika palace in front of Sree Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi Music Festival is held every year during this festival.  The biggest festival in this temple is Laksha deepam, which means hundred thousand  or one Lakh  lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. 56 day long Murajapam or uninterrupted recitation of prayers is conducted once in six years. On the festival time, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises on the auspicious day of Makara Sankranti  mid January . The next Laksha deepam is slated on January 2008. There are two half yearly 'Bhadradeepam' ceremonies and when twelve such had been performed, Murajapam and Lakshadeepam are conducted. The last full scale Murajapam was held in 1960.      Swathi Thirunal Maharaja had a very special relationship with Lord Padmanabha and the temple. His life was an offering to the Lord. All his songs carry the stamp of total dedication to Padmanabha. The most beautiful of his songs are on Lord Padmanabha.      The Ettara Yogam 8 Brahmins and the Venad King  was the traditional custodians of the day to day administration of the Sree Padmanabha Swami temple until Maharaja Marthanda Varma's reign. This temple is now managed by the Royal Thiruvithamkoor Family. Member of Irinjalakkuda Tharananalloor Mana is the chief priest or Tanthri. Priests are from the Kasargod Pathillams.

The 1000 pillared hall is              also the product of the late chola period, and is also in the 4th prakaram; its entrance              is in the south. It is here where the adhyayanotsavam  involving the recitation of the              Tamil Prabandam hymns   is held. At the southern edge of the huge open courtyard, the              Vijayanagara rulers added the hall with 8 pillars with huge horses. The Krishna Venugopala              shrine on the southern side is also of great beauty.  The Garuda mandapam s located                in the third prakaram.. Its pillars go back to the Nayaks of 17th century Madurai.              The Chandra and Surya Pushkarini tanks are located in the 3rd prakaram.   Legends  Legend has it that the image of Ranganatha worshipped here,              was originally worshipped by the clan of the Ishwakus, and it passed on to Rama. Rama upon              his victorious return from Lanka, handed over this image to Vibhishana, who proceded to              Lanka with the image. Circumstances caused him to place this image on the banks of the              Kaveri, where Srirangam now is.  see Ucchi Pillaiyaar Koyil                A disappointed Vibhishana returned to SriLanka with the consolation that the image of              Ranganatha at SriRangam would face South   in the direction of Lanka. A Chola monarch by              name Dharmavaraman is said to have created a temple here.

During              Ramanuja s time  12th century CE , Srirangam was a well established institution. The              Pandya rulers, from the 13th century onwards gave the temple, immeasurable support; the              gold plating of the vimanam being first of their endowments. The Hoysala kings, who set up              a military base outside Srirangam also made contributions. The temple was desecrated by              the Delhi armies in 1313, and was closed for 60 years. From the end of the 14th century,              the temple came back to life, and much of what is seen today is a result of  the              rebuilding activity which heppened during the time of the Vijayanagar rulers.   Festivals  An elaborate protocol of worship services is offered here              throughout the day. On about 120 days, the Utsavamurthy is taken out in procession out of              the inner sanctum. Aadi bhrammotsavam is celebrated in Panguni. The grand Adhyayanotsavam              is celebrated in the month of Margazhi, involving the recitation of the Prabandham hymns              or Alwar Pasurams in the thousand pillared hall.   Also in Srirangam is the Dasavataram temple, the only one of its kind, enshrining the              ten incarnations of Vishnu along with Lakshmi Narasimhar and Vishwaksenar.

Annamanada is a small town in the southwest corner of Thrissur district. It is situated 8 km from Mala and 10 km south of Chalakudy. The name Annamanada came from some Brahmin families  Manas  where Brahmins used to get free food  Annam  in older days. The village where Food  Annam  serving Brahmin families  manas  situated, later known as Annamanada.  Originally Annamanada was a part of Adoor gramam  one among the 64 brahmin gramams created by Parasurama  and Annamanada Mahadeva Temple  was the grama kshetra. Some of the neighboring villages still known as Meladoor, Keezhadoor etc. Meladoor Bhagavathy Temple is one among the 108 Durga Temples created by Parasurama.  Annamanada Mahadeva temple is located near the bank of Chalakudi River.  The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Shiva. The shivling is almost four feet tall and is considered as the Kiratamoorthy in a pleasing mood while giving Pashupatastra to Arjuna.   The temple faces to the east and the sanctum is square shaped. There is a low Valiabalikkal in front of the Agramandapam on the eastern side and a bali peetha equal in height of the basement of the shrikovil. The sopana with carved hasti hasta railings on either side provides access to the square Mukha Mandapam. The doors on the south and the west lead to the shrines of Lord Ganesh and Goddess Parvati respectively. The Mukha mandapam and the shrikovil have dvi tala structure, which is covered with copper sheet. The nalam balam of the temple has two thidappallies. On the northern side of the nalambalam lays the shrine of Lord Vishnu. In the outer prakaram  outer courtyard  there is a tank and the oottupura in the north east corner. The other deities of the temple are Shasta, Goshala Krishnan, Mahakali, Nagaraja, Durga mounted on lion and Narasimha.   The annual festival is celebrated during Kumbham  February or March . The festival lasts for ten days and is observed with pomp and pageantry. People from surrounding villages gather here for worshipping lord Shiva and Parvathy. Laksha deepam  one lack chirags  on sixth day is very famous. The Thiruvathira arattu on the concluding day of the annual festival is done in the Annamanada River. Tantries or chief priests are from Kuttalakkatt and Avanaparambu Nampoothiri illams.  Annamanata Mahadeva Temple is a Mahakshetra by all criteria, though less popular and known outside Thrissur district. It has all the constituent units of a Mahakshetra. Five poojas and three shribalis constitute the daily pooja routine. Pradosham, Shivarathri and Ardra  particularly in Dhanu  days are of special significance. With three Vishnu sannidhis, ashtami rohini also assumes importance in this temple.  Being one of the thirty two grama kshetras in the Kerala coast, the nucleus of the temple can be dated to an antiquity of at least 1200 years. Earlier the temple was being administered by about 10 or 12 mamboothiri illams who were the traditional uraymas of the temple. Subsequently, by the middle of the eighteenth century, the melkoyma  overlordship  was usurped by the Zamorin of Kozhikode. Cochin  in whose territory the temple was situated  successfully colluded with Travancore to oust the Zamorin from the over lordship of the temple. The namboothiris of the gramasanketham who did not relish the overall administration of Cochin, surrendered the melkoyma rights of the temple to the Travancore ruler. Travancore claimed and exercised sovereignty over the temple for about a century. Cochin ruler approached the British East India Company to mediate in their dispute with Travancore regarding melkoyma of the temple. By 1814 15 the East India Company who were meddling with the affairs of the princely states ruled that Cochin had sovereign rights over the Adoor Grama and the Annamanada temple, but certain rights of the temple were conceded to Travancore state. Later, considering the difficulty of exercising those special rights in a foreign territory, Travancore conceded those rights as well to the Cochin ruler in 1902. Now the temple is being administered by the Cochin Devaswom Board.  The main peculiarity of this temple is the sinking valiya balikkallu. The sinking of the valiabalikkal is attributed to the traditional explanation that it was ordained by the Lord for affording clear darshan from outside the naalambalam to the untouchable Pakkanar or to Perumthachan of the legendary Parayi petta Panthirukulam. The namaskaramandapa which is usually present in all the Mahakshetras is conspicuous by its absence. The mukhamandapam with wooden slat enclosure is devoid of the usual dvara paalaka sculptures, but dvara paalakas are supposed to be prakshiptham  concealed  as they have their share in bali oblation. The wood carvings in the Shrikovil and mukhamandapam as also those in the ceiling of the tow dvaragopurams deserve special mention.  The temple was well endowed earlier with an annual paattom  levy  of 64,000 paras of paddy and the agram  daily nivedyam  was of the order of 10 paras of rice per day. The temple has also contributed to the promotion of Koothu and Koodiyattom. Out of the 18 traditional Chakyar families of Kerala, the Mekkatt family had its original habitat near Annamanata temple and they were the sthanis there. Later, this family along with two other families   Valia Parisha of Ambalapuzha and Cheria Parisha of Kidangoor merged with the Kazhakuttom chakyars. Cheria parisha Parameswara chakyar is credited with the formulation of Mantrankom Koothu of Bhasa in current format in the Annamanata temple in the latter half of nineteenth century. The mantrankom koothu and koodiyattom used to last for 41 days during the Mandala Kaala starting from Vrishchigam first  Nov   Dec . In the absence of a Koothambalam, the valiambalam was the venue for staging plays and Annamanata temple is one of the two temples in Kerala where such marathon performance of Koothu used to be held in the Valiambalam in front of the main sannidhi.   The temple faces east. Main road access to the temple is on the western side. Entering through the east nata one comes across an astonishingly low Valiabalikkal just in front of the agramandapam. While generally, the height of the principal bali peetha is equal to the height of the adhishtana  basement  of the Shrikovil, here the uppermost layer i.e. the padma peetha alone projects outside the base to a height equal to the jagathy  lowermost square moulding  of the adhishtana.  Past the balikkal and agra mandapa one enters the inner courtyard  akathe balivattom  of the temple. There is no namaskara mandapa in front of the Shrikovil. The Sopana with carved hasti hasta bannisters on either side provides access to the square mukha mandapa. The sanctum is also square in shape. Both the Shrikovil and mukha mandapa are built up of granite up to the vedika. Further up, the shrikovil is built up of laterite, plastered over and decorated with panjaras and plain rectangular vertical niches interspersed in between. The ghanadvaras  false doors  on the south and west are utilised for the pratishtas of Ganapathy and Parvathy respectively. The ghanadvaras are adorned with toranas. Underneath the ghanadvara on the north runs the granite pranala supported on a dwarf figurine. The sanctum contains the Shiva linga, almost four feet tall and is considered to be Kiratamoorthy in a pleasing mood while giving Pashupatastra to Arjuna. The mukha mandapa in front is enclosed on the three sides with horizontal wooden slats fixed on outwardly sloping carved wooden frames. The upper floor walls of the mukha mandapa are made up of intricately carved wood panelling. Both the sanctum as well as the abutting mukha mandapa are dvi tala in structure, covered over with copper sheets. The upper floor eaves are supported by free standing carved wooden figures at intervals and the roofs are punctured and decorated with shuka nasas.  There are two thidappallies forming part of the naalambalam on either side of the main sanctum. Through a door on the northern side of the naalambalam, opposite the pranala one comes to an enclosure which contains the circular eka tala shrikovil of Vishnu with a square namaskara mandapa in front supporting a pyramidal roof. Both the structures have tiled roof. The vilakkumaadom structure encloses the naalambalam of Shiva sannidhanam as well as the Vishnu enclosure on its northern side, along the outer periphery. The independent gabled roofs of the two valiambalams, that of Shiva and Vishnu, present independent mukhappus  frontage  of the two major sannidhis, while that of Shiva extends forward over the agra mandapa in front accentuating its primacy.  In front of the agra mandapa is the extraordinary valiabalikkal, beyond which on the eastern side is the aanapandal with a tiled roof and the dhwaja stambha piercing that roof. In the outer balivattom are located the Shasta sannidhi facing west on the southern side of the naalambalam and the Goshala Krishnan adjoining the western boundary wall in the south west corner. In the north east corner of the outer courtyard are located the tank and the oottupura. The courtyard is enclosed by a tall compound wall pierced by openings in the four cardinal directions, of which those in the east and west natas are decorated with dvaragopuras with dvi tala tiled roof and with carved ceilings.  Outside the eastern dvaragopura on its south is situated the Mahakaali sannidhi and on the north east are the sannidhis of Nagaraja, Durga mounted on lion, Narasimha and Krishna with a large tank in between. The Annamanata river flows by facing the eastern facade at a distance of around 500 metres, wherein the aarattu of the Lord takes place on the concluding day of the annual festival. The devaswom office is located on the west nata beyond the dvaragopuram on the north west side. The main access to the temple is from the western side and the distance to the road point  Chalakkudy Mala bus route  is about 200 metres.

Much of the current structure                of the temple dates back to the 15th century.

The final day of this festival involves the enactment of Surasamharam.

Kottarakara means \"the land of the palace\". Kottaram means Palace and Kara means Land. The last queen of the Elayidathu Swaroopam voluntarily surrendered to King Marthanda Varma of Travancore in the 18th century. Kottarakara is the place where the classical art form of Kathakali was conceived and is a famous pilgrim centre for the Hindus as the seat of the famous Ganapathy Temple.   There are two Shiva temples in Kottarakkara  1 km west of M.C Road in Kottarakkara Kollam road . They are the Manikandeswaram Mahadeva Temple and Padinjattinkara Mahadeva Temple. The local people consider both of them with equal importance. Both these temples were the Paradevatha Temples of Elayidathu Swaroopam. It is not clear that which temple is mentioned in the Shivalaya Nama Stothra. So both these temples are presented here. Devotees can visit both these temples very easily because they are situated within a span of 50 meters. Both these temples are managed by Travancore Devaswom Board.  Manikandeswaram Mahadeva Temple is now famous as Kottarakkara Maha Ganapathy Temple. This is a Maha Kshetra with golden flag staff. Shiva is the main deity in this temple. However, Lord Ganapathy is very powerful and the temple became famous in His name. Idols of Lord Mahadeva  facing east  and Sree Parvathy  facing west  are in the same Sreekovil. The sreekovil is circular in shape with copper covered conical roof. Ganapathy idol faces south. The eleven day annual festival of Lord Shiva is in Medam  April May  and it ends with arattu on Thiruvathira day. There is a big pond infront of the temple. Three poojas will be conducted daily. Sastha, Subrahmanya and Naga Devathas are the sub deities.  There is a legend behind the installation of Ganapathy idol in this temple. This legend is associated with Perumthachan.  The royal sculpturist Perumthachan  The Master Carpenter  had a son who like him mastered and excelled in carpentry and architecture. His son soon excelled his own perfection. The fame of Perumthachan's son spread far and wide. This is said to have caused a sort of professional jealousy in Perumthachan. According to the Aithihyamala, Perumthachan dropped his chisel on his own son faking it as an accident. After the death of his son Perumthachan started wandering. One day he reached Kottarakkara. The Padinjattinkara temple was under renovation at that time. He saw a big piece of jack tree root inside the Sarppakkavu. It is believed that he sculptured a beautiful Ganapathy idol from the root of the jack tree. Perumthachan had seeked the permission of the tantri  chief priest  of Padinajattinkara temple to install the idol there. The tantri denied permission because there is already one Ganapathy idol. Hence Perumthachan changed his plans and later, having secured the permission of the tantri of Manikandeswaram temple installed the idol there. The melsanthi  head priest  was preparing nivedyam  offerings for the Lord  there. Perumthachan had studied the place and had found it ideal to install the deity there in the southeast direction.

Parthasarathy Temple is situated on the left bank of the Pampa river in a beautiful village called Aranmula. Aranmula is a small village, but is one of the destinations as specified the Discovery channel, one would definitely like to visit. Aranmula is located in Pathanamthitta district, 9 km west to Chengannur. Parthasarathy Temple is one among the Pancha Pandava Temples Thrichittat, Thirupuliyoor, Thiruvaranmula, Thiruvanvandoor and Thrikkodithanam  in Kerala. The Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple is vey famous and one of the biggest in Kerala. Aranmula is one among the 64 Brahmin gramams and Parthasarathy Temple is the Grama Kshetram. Lord Mahavishnu gave darsan to Lord Brahma and Vedavyasa at this place. Vishnu revealed the knowledge of creation to Bhrama, from whom the Madhu and Kaitabha demons stole the Vedas.  Legends of this temple is associated with Pandavas. After crowning Parikshit, Pandavas left for piligrimage. They visited Kerala during their piligrimage. In Kerala, each of these brothers installed idols of Lord Vishnu on the banks of the Pampa and nearby places Thrichittat   Yuddhishtra, Tiruppuliyoor   Bheema, Thiruvaranmula   Arjuna, Tiruvanvandoor   Nakula and Thrikkodithanam   Sahadeva  and offered worship. It is said  that Arjuna built this temple at Nilackal near Sabarimala to expiate for the sin of having killed Karna on the battlefield, against the dharma of killing an unarmed enemy. Nilakkal was a dense forest and hence it was difficult to perform daily poojas. So the idol was brought here in a raft made of six pieces of bamboo to this site, and hence the name Aranmula  six pieces of bamboo .  There is yet another legend associated with Parthasarathy here. On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra, the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma, when krishna motivated Arjuna to take initative and vanquish his foe. Upon his hesitating to do so, Krishna jumped down in rage, and took up his Sudarsana Chakra discus ; seeing this sight Bheeshma surrendered to him and Arjuna beseeched him not to kill Bheeshma, as it would bave been against Krishna's vow to take up arms in his battle. It is believed that it is this image of Krishna that is enshrined here, with a discus.  This temple has golden flag staff and has four towers over its entrances on its outer wall. The huge beautiful eastern tower is accessed through a flight of 18 steps. Descending 57 steps through the northern tower, one can reach the Pampa river. This temple is a perfect example for Kerala Temple architecture and its structure is almost similar to that of Ettumanor Mahadeva Temple.  Parthasarathy is the owner of 39 villages in and around Aranmula and people in these villages consider Lord Parthasarathy as their protector. There are many legends associated with Lord Parthasarathy. Some of them are acssociated with the famous Uthrattathi Vallamkali snake boat race  and Thiruvonathoni. The idol of Lord Parthasarathy was brought to this place from Nilackal in a raft made of six pieces of bamboo. Several Chundan Vallams snake boats  accompanied the procession through Pampa river. The idol was installed in the temple on Uthrattathi day of Malayalam month Chingam August September . Uthrattathi in Chingam is the birthday of Arjuna. To celebrate these events people of Aranmula started the famous snake boat race Uthrattathi Vallamkali.  It was a custom for the Bhattathirippad of Kattoor Mangatt Illam to offer lunch to Brahmins on the Thiru Onam day. This had been going on for years. One particular year, no brahmins turned up for the Onam Sadya. The Bhattathirippad prayed to Lord Parthasarathy to send a brahmin. Later a Brahmin boy came to the Illam and Bhattathirippad welcomed him for lunch. After the lunch as the boy was leaving, he told the Bhattathirippad \"I will not come again here for lunch\". That night, Bhattathirippad had a dream and understood that the boy was none other than Lord Parthasarathy. Lord Parthasarathy ordered him to bring rice and other material required for the 'Nivedyam' on Thiruvonam day from next year onwards. This made him decide to take particulars for Onam Sadya to Aranmula Temple from next year onwards. So the next year on Uthradam day   the day before Thirvonam, Bhattathirippad went to Aranmula Temple in a small thoni boat  with rice and other material required for the Nivedyam. The chief priest of the Aranmula Temple had a dream on that night. \"My devotte Mangatt Bhattathiri will bring the materials for Onasadya. You must receive him at the north gopuram. Make nivedyams with those materials.\" The priest informed this to the temple authorities and they decided to send some Palliyodams holy snake boats  to welcome Bhattathiri. Bhattathiri reached the temple with the materials and surprised by the warm welcome. He handed over the materials and the Deepam oil lamp  he brought from Kattoor Maha Vishnu temple to the priest. The priest lighted the lamps in side the sreekovil with this Deepam and the nivedyams were prepared and offered it to the Lord. A Kedavilakku is installed inside the sreekovil. There after it is a custom in this temple this tradition is continued even today.  Later the Bhattathiri faced some difficulties at Kattur and decided to leave from there. Lord allowed him to go to Kumaranalloor and told him that there His sister Goddess Kathyayani will help him. But the condition is that Bhattathiri must reach the Aranmula temple for Thiruvonam with materials for nivedyam. Bhattathiri agreed and went to Kumaranalloor. Mangattu Illom is now situated at Kumaranalloor near Kottayam. Every year the Karanavar the eldest member  of Mangattu Illam starts his journey in a small thoni boat  to Aranmula two days before Thiruvonam. Bhattathiri will seek the blessings of Kumaranalloor Kathyayani Devi before starting the journey. The thoni will move towards Aranmula through Meenachil, Manimala and Pampa rivers. Bhattathiri will reach the Kattoor Maha Vishnu Temple on Uthradam day. The devotees will bring the materials for Onasadya and Bhattathri will receive them. From here onwards he travels in the famous Thiruvonathoni.The Garuda faced Thiruvonathoni will set off from the Maha Vishnu Temple ghats at Kattoor, after the deeparadhana. On one occasion, the Thiruvonathoni was ambushed by scoundrels, and villagers' snake boats came to the rescue. Thereafter, all offerings for the feast were brought by snake boats. 'Paliyodams' belonging to the seven Palliyoda karas in the upstream of Kozhencherry will escort the Thiruvonathoni to Aranmula with the accompaniment of Vanchippattu, verses in praise of Lord Parthasarathy. It is a nice sight to see the thoni moving down the river Pampa without rowing. The thoni is symbolic of Lord vishnu's Garuda. On its way, the Thirvonathoni would first get to shore at Ayiroor madom and later at Melookara ashramam. The procession would reach Aranmula Temple by early morning of Thiruvonam and will be received at the  temple ghats. The Onasadya will be served on the temple premises after the 'utchapuja' on Thiruvonam day.   But it is interesting that on Thiruvonam day the Karanavars the eldest members  of four Illams in Aranmula will not take even a drop of water. These illams were once the Ooralars owners  of the temple. The Aranmula Temple had land properties in nearby villages.Naranganam was such a village. Once, during paddy harvest season, the Ooralars were measuring the harvest in a paddy field. A poor, low caste woman waited to get some paddy as a tip. She waited until the evening but was completely ignored by the landlords. She had been starving for days. That night, the poor woman lay down in a field, and, by the next morning, she was dead. Thereafter, misfortunes began to fall upon Aranmula and the landlords under the temple. It was revealed that it was the divine curse caused by the death of the poor woman. So, it was suggested that the Karanavars of these families must not take food and water on Thiruvonam day and feasts should be given to the public   regardless of religion, caste, or financial status   every year.  The Aranmula Uthrattathi Vallamkali, the world famous water carnival is the main important function related to this temple. The journey of the locals who used to accompany the Thiruvonathoni in their respective Palliyodams has evolved into the Aranmula Uthrattathi Vallamkali. This famous boat race in Pampa river will take place on Uthrattahy day in the Malayalam month of Chingam August September , 4 days after Thiruvonam. Palliyodams from 39 Karas from Chennithala in the west to Ranni in the east participate in the  Vallamkali. These boats assemble since dawn and sail in pairs for about 2 hours. Though, large snake boats take part in this festival they do not race with each other. Instead, they row in union, to the accompaniment of songs and reach their destination together because Lord Krishna is believed to be present in each boat. The oarsmen, wearing white dhotis with white scarfs around their heads, row the snake boats to the rhythmic tunes of Vanchippattu. After the Vallamkali there is an elaborate feast in the Aranmula temple.  The Palliyodams have some peculiarities when compared with ordinary snake boats or Chundan Vallams. They are called Pallyodams because they belongs to the Lord. They are constructed so that the head and tail project out five and three feet, respectively, above the water. Each boat must have 64 seating compartments for 64 oarsmen, representing 64 art forms. At the head of the boat on a raised platform are seats for four more master oarsmen who control the direction of the boat with large oars. These four oarsmen symbolize the four Vedas. In the middle of the boat is a platform for eight people to stand. They represent the Ashtadikpalakas  devas , who guard the eight directions. A snake boat is about 103 feet in length. Each boat has about 4 helmsmen 100 rowers and 25 singers. The total cost of building a snake boat is about Rs 1.6 million. It takes 650 man days to build a single snake boat.  This Vallamkali is an all community affair and participants include members of all classes and communities living in and around Aranmula. For peoples in Aranmula this vallamkali is more important than Onam. All of the local people participate in the festival. And all the pilgrims who come to Aranmula become the guests of the resident families. The festival is now being organised under the auspices of the Palli Oda Seva Sangham, a popular organization of the boat owners. In recent years, the festival attracts spectators from all parts of the country and from abroad.  Ashtamirohini   birth day of Lord Krishna   is also celebrated here in a grand style.The famous ritualistic mass feast, Ashtami Rohini 'vallasadya', will be held on this day. Thousands of devotees from different parts of the State will take part in  this feast and is considered as the 'prasadom' of the presiding deity. The Palliyoda Seva Sanghom  PSS  has been organising the vallasadya on the temple premises for the past several years. Rice is served along with 32 side dishes on the day. The vallasadya will begin in front of the holy temple mast immediately after the utcha pooja at the temple. More than 30 Palliyodams will participate in vallasadya and the temple premises will be packed with devotees right from the morning. The Palliyodams carrying devotees from each kara in and around Aranmula will stage the Ashtami Rohini boat race and will reach the temple ghats in a procession by 11 a.m. After a rousing reception they will circumambulate the temple, chanting the vanchippattu, verses in praise of Lord Krishna, before partaking of the vallasadya. For the vallasadya held in 2006, 3250 kg of rice had been used and not less than 40,000 people had partaken of the feast.  There is a subshrine for Lord Balarama near to the northern gopuram. This shrine is located in a big pit and devotees have to step down to get the darsan of Lord Balarama. There is no other sub deities in this temple. The Thiruvonathoni is kept in a special place near to the western Gopuram.  The 10 day long annual festival in Makaram January February  begins with kodiyettam on Atham day and ends with arattu on Thiruvonam day. The malayala month of Meenam witnesses a festival where Aranmula Parthasarathy is taken in a grand procession on the Garuda Vahana to the Pampa river bank, where an image of the Bhagavathi from the nearby Punnamthode temple is brought in procession for the arattu festival. Another festival celebrated here is the Khandavadahanam celebrated in the malayalam month of Dhanus. For this festival, a replica of a forest is created in front of the temple with dried plants, leaves and twigs. This bonfire is lit, symbolic of the Khandava forest fire of the Mahabharata. It is from here that the sacred jewels of Lord Ayyappa are taken in procession to Sabarimala each year in Dhanu December .  Vallasadya is a famous offering in Aranmula Temple. On this the offered village will conduct a boat race in the Pampa river and will have a feast at the temple. The feast will have hundreds of items and sweets. But the peculiarity of this offering is that it's not for Brahmins and only Nairs will attend this feast. Other main offerings are Chandanam Charthal, Pushpanjali and Palppayasam. This temple is managed by Travacore Devaswom Board.  Like Lord Guruvayoorappa, Lord Parthasarathy also like elephants. Now there are 3 elephants in this temple. Aranmula Valiya Balakrishnan and Gajarajan Aranmula Raghunathan were the famous elephants of Lord Parthasarathy.

These temples are located at Kottiyoor, on the banks of Bavali River. Kottiyoor Mahadeva Temple is  an important pilgrim centre of North Kerala and is situated sixty five kilometes northeast from Thalessery. Kottiyoor Mahadeva is usually refered as Kottiyoor Perumal. Kottiyoor is often described as the 'Varanasi of the South'.   It is believed that Prajapathy Daksha father of Sathi Devi performed a Yaga at this place.Sathi Devi was the consort of Lord Shiva. Sathi had married Shiva against the wishes of her father. The vain Daksha performed a great yagna  with the sole aim of insulting Shiva , to which he invited all of the gods and goddesses except his daughter and son in law to participate in it. Sathi, who was angry at this treatment of her father, went to her father's place to ask the reason for it. Daksha insulted Sathi again by calling Shiva poor and wild. Being the ideal consort of Shiva, Sathi could not bear the fact that her husband was being insulted in front of the guests. She immediately jumped into the yagna fire out of shame and anger and killed herself.   Knowing this, Lord Shiva, became very angry and came to Daksha's palace.On the orders of Lord Shiva, his demons Veerabhadra and Bhadrakali destroyed the yaga and Veerabhadra beheaded Daksha. On seeing the dead body of Sathi, Shiva was so enraged that, he lifted the body on his shoulder and started dancing the tandav  the dance of destruction . The dance continued for several days and the earth was on the brink of being destroyed. Then, on the appeal of all the other gods and goddesses, Lord Vishnu with the help of his Sudarsana chakra, started cutting Goddess Sathi's body. It is said that the parts of Sathi's body fell at different parts of the country, which are all considered centers of power or 108 Shakti Peethas.Akkare Kottiyoor Temple  Later, conceding to the plea of Brahma and Vishnu, Lord Siva gave life to Daksha and completed the yaga. Daksha understood his faults and started worshipping Lord Shiva. Shiva appeared infront of him in the form of a Swayambhoo Lingam. Kapila Maharshi and Lord Parasurama worshipped this Swayambhoo Lingam for a long period. Later this place became a dense forest. Once a Kurichyan a tribal  went into this forest to collect logs. His weapon struck the Swayambhoo Lingam and it began to bleed and he informed it to the lords and thus the place for Shiva of Kottiyoor was located. This Swayambhoo Lingam is in the Akkare Kottiyoor temple. This Lingam is in a forest and so the brahmins were unable to reach there to worship the Lingam daily. So they decided to offer poojas to this Lingam only for 28 days in an year. This was the wish of Lord Shiva too. Inorder to perform daily poojas they constructed a temple on the opposite bank of Bavalee river. This is the present Ikkare Kottiyoor temple. The Bavalee river is considered holy by the temple devotees. In Akkare Kottiyoor temple, there is no temple. The Swayambhoo Lingam is on a \"thara\" formed by a small heap of stones, called Manithara. This is the only visible signs of the ancient temple that draws thousands of faithful every year. Many feel the Siva power is solidified as the idol here.  Every year during May June, it is festival season here, with thousands of devotees throng to see and participate the 27 day long festival. This festival is akin to the yaga performed by Daksha.A sword, which is believed to have decapitated the mythical character Daksha is brought to the Ikkara Kottiyoor temple from the Muthirikavu it is an object of daily workship of Muthirikavu  temple, which marks the beginning of the annual festival. There is no worship at Ikkare Kottiyoor temple for the festival month. For the festival month Ikkare Kottiyoor temple is closed and the worships are taken place at Akkare Kottiyoor temple, which is closed for the other eleven months. The annual festival commences with Neyyattam pouring of ghee  on the Swathi Chothy day of the Malayalam month Edavam  May June  and ends with Thirukalasattu, after 28 days. Neyyattam and Elaneerattam pouring of tender coconut water  are special ceremonies connected with the festival. Innumerable temple rites are performed here during the festival time. Remaining period the Akkare Kottiyoor temple is closed. Before trekking on the holy hills of Kottiyoor devotees will take a bath in Bavalee river. They carry with them auda flowers  white fibres flowing down and looks very much like a white beard . These special days on which abhisheka is held are considered most auspicious in the month long annual festival here. The exotic and esoteric religious rituals here make this festival stand apart from the other temple festivals in Kerala.  Women are permitted only for some particular days. The \"Pradhama Sthaneeyar\" of Kottiyoor is from the Thekkedath Family of Kankol.  Kannoth Kunhikannan of Chala once went to the forest to measure and assess the land of Kottiyoor Perumal. There he saw Karimpalars tribals  cutting cane for Elaneerkav. Kunhikannan demanded some cane; but they refused to give them. Kunhikannan forcefully took cane and beat the tribals. They went in front of the temple, cried and informed the God. Two snakes went away from there and entered the field of Kunhikannan in the form of two leeches. His younger sister was the Kettilamma of Chirakkal Thampuran and she was pregnant. On her way home, she got down from the palanquin in the field and the leeches bit her to death. Although the usual post death performances were done, the crows did not touch the 'bali' rice. On astrological inquiry, it is understood that there was the anger of Kottiyoor Perumal and he had to present a gold cane as an atonement.

Suchindram is about 11 km from Kanyakumari and about 7 km from Nagarkoil lying between these two towns.This temple is dedicated to Trimurthis  Brahma,Vishnu and Shiva. The name Sthanumalaya denotes the combination of the Trimurthis. Sthanu is a synonym for Siva, Mal for Vishnu and Ayan for Brahma. It is believed that the top, middle and base of the Linga in the temple represent Siva, Vishnu and Brahma respectively. Suchindram is also famous as Njanaranyam.  The place got the name of Suchindram, according to the Sthalapurana, as Indra was relieved of a curse. Once Indra was infatuated with Ahalya, the wife of Rishi Gautama. One night he came to the hermitage where Gautama was living and crowed like a cock indicating the approach of dawn. Rishi Gautama thinking that dawn was imminent awoke from his sleep and went to the river for his ablutions prior to commencing his prayers. Realising that it was too dark for dawn and too early for morning to break he returned to his hut. In the meantime Lord Indra took the physical appearance of Rishi Gautama, approached Ahalya and satisfied his desire. Rishi Gautama returning from the river was enraged when he saw his wife in another man s embrace and cursed the man's entire body be covered with 'yoni'  the female organ  and his wife Ahalya to become a statue of stone. Lord Indra in order to get rid of this curse went to Njanaranya and prayed to the Thrimoorthis to rid him of this curse. When he was rid of his curse and transformed into his original form he built a temple and installed the Lingam to represent the Thrimoorthis, and the name of the place came to be known as Suchi Indran  the place where Indran was purified .According to the believers, Indra even now visits the temple daily for performing \"Ardhajama Pooja\" in the night.  Sage Athri lived here with his wife Anasuya, who was considered a chaste woman. When the Thridevis Goddesses Saraswathy, Lakshmi and Parvathy  heard through Sage Naradha the powers of this earthly woman they wanted to test her chastity. They approached their husbands Lords Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to test Anasuya's devotion to her husband. Lords Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma visited her once in the absence of her husband to test and prove her chastity to the world. They came as sanyasis asking alms and bade Anasuya to feed them, but without any dress. But Anasuya was not baffled and she just prayed to her husband and transformed the Lords into three small babies  Shiva as Durvasa, Vishnu as Dattatreya and Brahma as Chandra  and fed them. The Goddesses learning what had happened pleaded with Anasuya to give them back their husbands. Anasuya then prayed to her husband to restore them back to their original form.Thrimurthis and Thridevis accepted that Anasuya's fame as the chastest woman on earth was justified. Anasuya requested them to stay there.Thus the Thrimoorthy came to be represented by the Lingam at Suchindram.  The legends about this temple is also associated with the Kanayakumari Devi Temple. Lord Shiva started from this place to wed Kanyakumari Devi. The marriage was to take place at midnight on a certain auspicious day. When Shiva was in the town of Vazhukkamparai  5 km from Suchindarm , Narada assumed the form of a rooster and crowed, falsely heralding the break of dawn. Thinking that he had missed the appointed hour of his marriage, Shiva returned to Suchindram. The Kanyakumari Devi became angery and started penance and later killed Banasura.  Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya visited this temple and praised Sthanumalaya with beautiful Stothras hymns . There are two important festivals, one in Dhanu  December January  and the other in Medam  April May . During the Dhanu festival, on the 9th day the deities are taken out in procession around the streets on three festival cars.  Thirumalai Naykkkan and the Travancore Maharajas, under whose administration the temple remained till Kanyakumari's merger with Tamil Nadu, have made many endowments for its upkeep. The temple is an architectural marvel and is noted for its 'musical' columns and its impressive 3 m tall statue of Hanuman. Two chief attractions are the gigantic Hanuman and Vainayaki  Female Vinayaka  relief carving. The Nandi image in the temple, which is 13 feet high, 21 feet long and 10 feet wide, is one of the biggest of its kind in the country. The main Gopuram is 134 feet high. This temple attracts both Vaishnavites and Saivites in large numbers. About 30 shrines to various deities within the temple complex, the large Lingam in the sanctum, the idol of Vishnu in the adjacent shrine and a large idol of Hanuman at the Eastern end of the Northern corridor represent almost all the deities of the Hindu pantheon.

The Brahmin Kings of Edappalli and Paravoor had a vigorous argument in the case of Daasiyattom at the famous Thirumoozhikkulam Lakshmana Temple in Ernakulam District. The Edappalli King failed and it is said that the King himself took the Sheeveli Thidambu of Thirumoozhikkulam Lakshmana Perumal and later he constructed a temple in Mulakkulam and installed the Thidambu there.

The quarrel was held between the  Akakkoyma and Purakkoyma  families of Thirumoozhikkulam.        There is also a history which says that the Lakshmana Thidambu belongs to the Thirumarayoor Rama Temple. Originally the Thirumarayoor Temple had Rama and Lakshmana Prathishtas. Due to the revolt between Brahmins of Thirumarayoor some Brahmins took the Lakshmana Thidambu which was ought to move for Para Ezhunnallathu ritual, to Moozhikkulam.

It is situated in Thrikkakara, 2 kilometers east of Idapally near Cochi. The name Thrikkakkara means the holy place where Lord placed His foot. Thiru kal kari later became Thrikkakara   The legend is closely linked with the story of Mahabali and Lord Vishnu's Vamana or Trivikrama incarnation. Mahabali was an efficient and popular Asura king. His kingdom stretched the earth, the patala  the underground , and was threatening the skies. The gods  suras  grew worried of Mahabali's rule and popularity. Vishnu, in his avatar as Vamana, asked Mahabali for a piece of land only three paces wide. Bali, ever the generous king, granted this wish, whereupon Vamana grew to an immense size and covered the heavens with one step and the earth with another. There was no space left for Vamana to measure his third pace. \"Where is my third foot of space \" asked Vamana. Tricked by this deceit, but as one who would never go back on his promises. Mahabali offered his own head for Vamana to place his third step. These events were happened at this place. As he was pushed down into Suthala, King Bali made a last request. He requested that he be allowed to visit Kerala once in a year to ensure that his people were still happy, well fed and content. Lord Vishnu was pleased to grant Mahabali his wish. Mahabali comes to visit his people and his land during Onam. This is the legend behind the Onam festival. Another legend associated with this temple is that Kapila maharshi did penance here and Vishnu pleased with the rishi s penance appeared before the rishi. At the behest of the rishi, Vishnu decided to stay in this place.  In pasurams of Nammalvar Thrikkakara is refered as Thirukkaatkarai, Lord Vamana as Sree Kaatkarai Appa Perumal and Thayar  Mahalakahmi  as Perunselva Naayaki or Vaathsalya valli.   The traditional festival of Kerala   Onam historically too related with this temple. The 10 day long annual festival in this temple is held in the month of Chingam  Augest   September . The utsavam begins with kodiyettu on Atham day and ends with arattu on Thiruvonam day. Thiruvonam is the birth day of Lord Vamanamoorthy. Those who could not attend this utsavam celebrated it in their own home by making beatuiful Pookkalams and by offering special nivedyams to Thrikkakkarayappan. This was strictly follwed in every home because it was an order given by the then ruling Cheraman Perumal, the king of Kerala. These celebrations and special offerings to Lord Vamana is now commonly known as Onam. The famous Athachamayam at Tripunithura was a triumphant march of the Maharaja of Kochi, with or without military intent from Tripunithura, the then capital of the Cochin state, to the Vamana Temple at Thrikkakara to attend the kodiyettu ceremony. It is merely a celebration to herald Onam, the festival of peace and equity, remembering the days when everything was in abundance. The Onasadya or the Onam feast will be held on Thiruvonam day in a grand manner in the temple with a large number of people cutting across religious barriers participating in it.  In this temple there are two seperate sreekovils for Lord Vamana and Lord Shiva. Five poojas   Ushapooja, Ethruthapooja, Pantheeradypooja, Uchapooja and Athazhapooja   and three Sheevelis  Ethrutha Sheeveli, Ucha Sheeveli and Athazha Sheeveli are conducted daily. The sub deities of Vamana temple are Sree Bhagavathi, Sastha, Gopalakrishna, Nagam, Rakshass and Yakshi.  The Shivalinga in this temple is believed to be worshiped by Mahabali himself and is situated on the southern side of Vamana shrine. Devotees must visit the Shiva shrine before visiting Vamana shrine. The Shiva temple or Thekkumkara Thevar temple has shrines of Parvathi, Durga, Bhagavathi, Subramanian and Ganapathy. It is interesting to note in this context that though Thrikkakkara Appan or Vamana is worshipped during Onam celebrations, Mathevar or Mahadevar is also worshipped with equal fervour and the reason remains unexplained.  The temple pond in the northern side is called Kapila Theertham and is considered holy. Only the temple priests are allowed to enter into this pond compound. The seat of King Mahabali is located infront of the Mahadeva sreekovil.  Once a farmer prayed to Thirkkakkarayappa that he would present with a bunch of golden bananas if his plantation yielded fruits. Thirkkakkarayappa blessed the land and there was a heavy yield of Kadalipazham a type of plantain. The farmer kept up his promise by making golden bananas and at the behest of the priest he left the bunch of golden bananas outside the Sreekovil and left the place. When the priest returned after bath, he was shocked to see the bunch missing. As only a yogi was present there, he suspected the yogi and the matter was reported to the king. People started accusing the yogi for the theft. Next day, when the pujari performed abhishekam to the Lord, he observed that the abhisheka water was getting stagnated . This was because the drain hole was blocked with the golden bunch of bananas. The pujari realized his mistake and the king and others along with the pujari approached the yogi for forgiveness. But the humiliated yogi before committing suicide cursed them that they would lose their wealth and that his curse would end only after the town lost all its wealth. Accordingly,the town lost all its wealth. The yogi became a brahma rakshass due to his untimely death and the people to protect themselves from the wrath of the brahma rakshass constructed a small shrine and offered prayers to him. Even today, after nivedyam is offered to Thirkkakkarayappa the same is offered to the brahma rakshass too.   Vamanamoorthy Temple is of great mythological significance. Most number of stone manuscripts were found in this temple amongst Kerala temples. The Thrikkakkara temple has about 18 important stone inscriptions dating back to 10 13 A.D. The inscriptions which were published in the Travancore Archeological Series in 1916 by Mr. T.A. Gopinatha Rao  1916  and Mr. K.V. Subramania Iyer  1923  are in Vattezhuthu, the prototype of Malayalam. Thrikkakkara or Thirukalkarai, as it was known in the days of the Kulasekharas, was the capital of Kalkarainadu, a fiefdom under the Kulasekharas, it is believed. But there is no documentary evidence to prove it.  From the Thrikkakkara edicts emerges a picture of the Kulasekhara empire which existed till about 1102 A.D., as well as the socio political and religious milieu of the times. It is believed that Kalakarainadu constituted the present Thrikkakkara, Edappally and surrounding areas. The names of a few chieftains appointed as naduvazhis of Kalkarainadu by the Kulasekhara kings who ruled from their capital Mahodayapuram are mentioned in the inscriptions most of which were written during the reign of the Kulasekhara kings Indukothai Varma  944   962  and Bhaskara Ravi Varman I  963   1019 . One record also mentions the existence of Arunoottuvar or the 'Group of 600' who helped and controlled the naduvazhis  During the reign of Kulasekharas who were great patrons  and followers  of Vaishnavism, Hindu temples flourished in Kerala and Thrikkakkara was a major beneficiary of this royal patronage as can be seen from the inscriptions which mention generous to the temple.  By the turn of this century, Thrikkakkara Temple was in utter ruins with only the Adhishtana remaining. All the standing structures were dilapidated and the image of the deity was also broken down. After repeated pleas from the Vaishnavaites and the report of the Archeology Department the Maharaja of Travancore reconstructed the temple in its present form. Remnants of the old temple wall described by Nammalvar as 'kodimathil' can still be traced beneath the new structure and the pathway surrounding the temple.  The Thrikkakkara Temple that dates back to ancient times has no mention whatsoever about the Namboodiris, the community that held sway over Kerala after the advent of Hinduism. Neither is Edappally Swaroopam, the erstwhile principality with a Namboodiri ruler that had adjoined Kochi and had played a major historical role in Kerala, mentioned in the records. The temple and inscriptions might be older than the emergence of Namboodiris as a force and the formation of Edappally Swaroopam. But later the ruler of Edappally became the official priest there and till recently held the right to nominate the priest.  The inscriptions describe the celebration of Onam as an occasion when all local chieftains assembled at Thrikkakkara to pay their respect to the Kulasekhara Chakravarthi  Emperor . The festivities started from the star of Thiruvonam in the Malayalam month of Karkatakam and lasted for 28 days till Thiruvonam in the month of Chingam. The last 10 days saw the peak of celebrations. Later the festival was confined to these 10 days beginning from the Atham star in Chingam. The records describe the celebrations in detail and the roles assigned to each king. It is not clear whether the festival had any religious significance at that time. The festival of Onam that first began to be celebrated at Thrikkakkara has spread from there, spanning caste and creed, penetrating the farthest corner of the world where Malayalees have reached, even as the cold inscriptions from a bygone era remain silent spectators for all the pomp and splendour of the celebrations raging around every year.

Kidangoor is historically one of the 64 villages of the Namboodiris established by Parasurama. It was the boundary of the Thekkumkur Vadakkumkur Kingdoms. The 14 Brahmin families of Kidangur were the owners of this temple. Out of the 14 Brahmin families some did not have male discendents, so those who had male members became the sole owners of this temple even to the present day.  Lord Subrahmanya in this temple is famous as Thrukkidangoorappan. Parighapuresan is another name for the Lord because Kidangoor is also alled Parighapuram. Subrahmanya is worshipped in Brahmachari Bhava. Lord considers all women who enters in the temple as His mother  Goddess Sree Parvathy . When mother comes to see her son he has to bow and worship her by leaving the Sreekovil. In order to avoid this difficulty, women are not permitted to enter inside the nalambalam. They can worship the lord by entering into the Valiyambalam through Balikkalppura.

Hence this river got the name Gauna Nadi. Gauna Maharshi filled his Kamandalu with Sapthanadi Theertham  water from the 7 holy rivers   Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswathy, Sindhu, Narmmada, Godavari and Kaveri . A beautiful idol of Lord Subrahmanya was also kept in his kamandalu. He was eagerly waiting for the Darshan of Lord Sree Rama in his return journey to Ayodhya after killing Ravana. Sree Rama was accompanied by large number of devotees like Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Hanuman and Angada in the Pushpaka Vimana. So Maharshi Gauna could not see Lord Sri Rama and Sita Devi properly. So the angry Gauna threw the kamandalu away and the idol of Subrahmanya Swami came out. These incidents occured on a hill and since then the hill is known as Kudamuruttimala. This flow of water became a river and thus the present Gauna nadi was formed. Along wih the flow of the water, the idol was carried away to the Vishnu temple in Kidangoor and was later installed in a new sreekovil. This is the present Kidangoor Subrahmanya Swami Temple.

The old name of Taliparamba was 'Lakshmipura' as this place was considered as an abode of prosperity. All the fame and prosperity to Perinchelloor Gramam is because of the presence of Sree Raja Rajeswara temple and the blessings of Perum Thrikkovilappan. Perinchelloor Gramam has been referred in the Tamil book \"Pathittupathu\",Chelloor Nadhodaym Chambu  Sanskrit , Kerala Pazhama, Kerala Mahatmyam, Jambukolpathi, Kokila Sandesam, Keralolpathi and many more. Between A.D.216 and 333 Perinchelloor was the capital of Chera Kingdom ruled by Cheraman Perumals as referred in \"Pathittupath\".  This temple has a prominent place amongst the numerous Shiva temples in South India. If any problem is encountered in temples of South India, the final solution is sought in this Temple through a prasna, a traditional method of astrological decision making. The prasna is conducted on a peedha  a raised platform  situated outside the temple. Taliparamba is one among 108 Shiva Temples in Kerala ancient Kerala from Gokarnam to Kanyakumari  created by Lord Parasurama. Among these temples 12 are considered as most important and called Dwadasa Shivalayas 12 shiva temples .

Taliparamba is regarded as one of the ancient Shakti Peethams. Legend has it that the head of Sati fell here after Shiva's tandavam following Sati's self immolation. So this temple is also popularly known as Rajarajeswari Temple. Siro Peetham or Sirassu head  is the other names given for Rajarajeswari Temple in some ancient documents. Interestingly Taliparamba Rajarajeswari Temple is also included in the list of 108 Durga Temples created by Lord Parasurama. In the list Taliparamba is mentioned as \"Sirassilum\".  Taliparamba temple is also one among the 18 Tali temples in Kerala. In the past, the entire Kerala was split up into temple states with village or gramam as the administrative unit and these all temple states were under 18 Tali temples. The gramam was administered by Kazhakam an advisory Board with an officer called Taliatiri. These villages were called Talis. Among such 18 tali temples, Taliparamba was one and it was very famous at it. The presiding deity of the Tali was the head and every thing was done in his name. The territory enjoying the Lord's administration was called Sanketam. The Talitris were carrying on many philanthropic activities including running of Vedapathasalas.   The quadrangular sanctum has a two tiered pyramidal roof. In front of the sanctum is the namaskara mandapam. The temple has no kodi maram  flagstaff  as opposed to other temples in Kerala. The balikkal has no roof but is embellished by a mysterious figure with a peculiar face. In front of the balikkal is a small rectangular building with a pyramidal roof, which is not usually found anywhere else. An inscription on the structure of the temple tank  which is a little away from the temple on the north side  indicates that the temple and the tank were renovated in 1524 A.D.  The Namaskara Mandapa  mukha mandapa  infront of the Sreekovil sanctum sanctorum  is the place where Lord Sree Rama  on his way back to Ayodhya from Lanka after defeating Ravana  prostrated before Raja Rajeswara. As a respect to Sree Rama no one is allowed into this namaskara mandapa and offer prayers, which is permitted in other temples for Brahmins.   In the past, Kerala was divided into many small kingdoms and there were many kings rulers. They all considered Lord Rajarajeswara as their Chakaravarthy  Rajarajeswara or King of Kings . The Taliparamba region was ruled by Zamorins Samoothiri  of Kozhikkod Calicut  and they were devotees of Lord Rajarajeswara. One of the Zamorins was an ardent devotee of the Lord of Taliparamba. After years of intense worship he is said to have entered the sanctum sanctorum and merged with the Lord. Even today, when the elder Zamorin dies, the information should be given to the temple authorities and the Lord is supposed to observe mourning. Even the distant Travancore kings paid obeisance to the deity by offering an elephant whenever a ruler is crowned or visited the temple.  The Taliparamba temple also was subject to attack by Tipu Sultan. One finds relics of the old gigantic gopuram at the entrance, which was demolished by Tipu's army. The story goes that when the temple was under siege, the head priest was inside the sanctum sanctorum and prayed ceaselessly day and night. it is further said that a black snake bit the commander of the army and a hooded serpent appeared before every soldier thus immobilizing the army and saving the temple from total destruction.  J.Jayalalitha, the former Chief Minister of Tamilnadu visited Sri Rajarajeshwara Temple at Taliparamba in 2001. Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa offered worship at Rajarajeswara Temple many times and in November 2008, he had offered an elephant. He worshipped Lord Rajarajeswara amid the political crisis faced by his government following the decision by 19 MLAs to withdraw support to the BJP government and he survived from the crisis. But even today none of the ministers of Kerala have the courage to enter the temple of Lord Rajarajeswara.  The place is considered as most sacred for performing Koodiyattam and Chakyar Koothu. Whenever a new Koodiyattam is being directed, first it is usually performed at this temple. However only the 'Maani' family of Chakyars solely posses the right of performing Koodiyattam here. Legendary Koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu maestro, Natyaachaarya Vidushakaratnam Padma Shri Maani Madhava Chakyaar had performed here for many decades.
